Brian Eno
2 Forms of Anger
This taste of Eno&#039;s new album nearly conflates his entire oeuvre: There&#039;s ambient drift, murky, data-storm rhythms and art-punk rave-up. Anger from the guru of chill? Bring it on.

Mary J. Blige
25/8
Congratulations appear to be in order for Mr. Blige, who, according toQueen Mary&#039;snew single, receives not just round-the-clock loving but bonus time too &ndash; 25 hours a day, eight days a week. It&#039;s goopy stuff, but it&#039;s also far more neck-poppin&#039; fun thanBeyonc&eacute;&#039;s"1+1."

Gaslight Anthem
45
Brian Fallon of the Gaslight Anthem has been in a kind ofTom Waits-meets-Billy Joelphase of late, especially in his side band the Horrible Crowes. But the title of the Jersey group&#039;s new single suggests Gaslight&#039;s forthcoming album will be a return to their sincerity-drunk heartland-hardcore basics. "45" is, of course, the RPM speed of a punk seven-inch single, as well as something you flip over when you want a fresh start. Fallon shouts about how his friends helped him get over a breakup, while the emo-Springsteenguitars hoist him aloft and repave Thunder Road.

Lil Wayne
6 Foot 7 Foot
Wayne&#039;s first post-prison single (which he cut forTha Carter IV) suggests his teeming brain was eating itself during all that time alone: Rarely has the man sounded so virtuosically loopy. Over thick synth burble and a "Banana Boat Song" sample, he makes up for lost nooky ("Never met the bitch but I fuck her like I missed her") and sprays intense metaphysical graffiti all over: "Life is the bitch and death is the sister/Sleep is the cousin/What a fuckin&#039; family picture."

Timbaland feat. Brandy
808
A month into his track-a-week "Timbaland Thursdays" series, Timbo already seems stretched thin. "808" is Tim-boilerplate: some kind words for his favorite drum machine, a few breaths of Brandy and a bland skitter beat.

Hugo
99 Problems
Ever wonder what a Robert Plant reworking of Jay-Z&#039;s &quot;99 Problems&quot; might sound like? New Roc Nation signee Hugo has the answer. This mystic acoustic number feels a bit like a novelty, but the heavy, banjo-laden production hits hard.

Missy Elliott feat. Timbaland
9th Inning
The duo responsible for this century&#039;s most wacked-out and visionary party music is back with two songs from Elliott&#039;s upcoming first album in seven years &ndash; but the mood is not quite celebratory. Timbaland&#039;s beats (his finest in some time) have a dark cast, with classical flourishes brooding over minor keys and the usual woozy, oddly accented beats and blips. The lyrics find Missy in a defensive crouch: "Thought I fell off?/Ain&#039;t quite finished," she raps in "9th Inning." In the moderately more upbeat "Triple Threat," we get a hint of the old goofy braggart: "I&#039;m a pretty diva/Call me se&ntilde;orita..../Hits like Venus and&nbsp;Serena."

How To Destroy Angels
A Drowning
The first single from Trent Reznor&#039;s new project (his wife, Mariqueen Maandig, is on vocals) is a seven-minute slow-burner decked out with squealing horns and whispered lyrics about slipping off into oblivion. Creepy? A little. But it&#039;s also too sleepy.

Cults
Abducted
This buzzy New York duo take Sixties girl-group pop sounds and wash them out in haunting reverb. Singers Brian Oblivion and Madeline Follin sound extra-ghostly on this sugary ode to lost love, trading eerily happy verses about kidnapped hearts.

Arcade Fire
Abraham&#039;s Daughter
Count on Arcade Fire to throw a funeral at the multiplex. Their haunting, cathedral-huge battle hymn for Hunger Games updates a Civil War-era song about volunteers giving their lives for the Union, adding a ghost-children chorale led by R&eacute;gine Chassagne, a martial pulse and lyrics about &ldquo;angels crying for the slaughter.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s some of the starkest, and creepiest, music the band has ever made &ndash; chamber rock strewn with black bunting and dipped in goth war paint.

Morrissey
Action Is My Middle Name
The Mozzer recently announced that he has a new album all ready to go &ndash; just no label to release it. (Label? What is this, the freaking Nineties?)Morrisseydebuted three of the new tracks live on BBC radio. Each song is in the heavy glam-rock mode of his last couple of solo albums, but the clear keeper of the bunch is&nbsp;the brilliantly titled "Action Is My Middle Name," exactly the kind of sardonically obsessive sex rant Morrissey has always done so well. He tries to convince some handsome devil that there&#039;s more to life than books, you know, with a killer opening line: "Biting my initials into your neck."

Incubus
Adolescents
Five years after their last album, Incubus are still smoothing and softening the tantrum edge of what used to be called new metal, and still doing it pretty skillfully. The churning guitars here give arena emo an arty gloss.

Blink-182
After Midnight
Older, possibly wiser and presumably more fully clothed, the torchbearers of the early-&#039;00s pop-punk boom have returned with their knack for tunesmithery intact. The second single fromBlink-182&#039;ssixth LP,Neighborhoods&ndash; the first was the sweeping"Up All Night"&ndash; is a melancholy confession about partying too hard: "We&#039;ll stagger home after midnight/Sleep on and on in the stairwell/We&#039;ll fall apart on the weekend." The midtempo ballad is a bit on the stolid side; it doesn&#039;t have the sparkle and fizz of the best Blink. But the sound is comfortingly familiar: the guitar crunch, the tuneful sneer of Mark Hoppus and Tom DeLonge&#039;s vocals, and Travis Barker&#039;s whip-cracking snare hits. Aughts nostalgia starts right here.

Noel Gallagher
AKA...What A Life!
TheOasisbro&#039;s latest solo tune is a piano-driven dance rocker that sounds a little likeColdplay, who now wear the Brit-pop crown that Oasis first forged. But there&#039;s more ecstasy than melodrama here, which bodes well for his LP. Here&#039;s hoping for a Chemical Brothers remix.

Regina Specktor
All The Rowboats
The classically trained pianist&#039;s new single is a wickedly baroque paean to decaying classics."It&#039;s their own fault forbeing timeless," Spektor charges over chase-scene scales and spitball synths, her fingers secretlycrossed for aNight at the Museum-style revolt.

MGMT
All We Ever Wanted Was Everything
For their version of this aching, uncharacteristically folksy ballad by post-punk goths Bauhaus, MGMT stir in enough dubby echo and effects to give it their own woozy imprimatur. Gloom becomes psychedelic sparkle, as is their way.

!!!
AM/FM
On their first single from their new LPStrange Weather, Isn&#039;t It?, the Brooklyn dance-rockers (who pronounce their name "chk chk chk") deliver a fat slice of funk that has all the sleaze and residue of a &#039;70s New York disco. You canhearthe porn-star mustache on "AM/FM," from the chubby bassline to the ditzy backup vocals. Singer Nic Offer&#039;s vocals barely cut through the mix — his lyrics are too dunked in reverb. But this song is more about the groove than the lyrics. As its title suggests, "AM/FM" goes back to a time when those letters still meant something.

Robert Plant
Angel Dance
Plant is a Zen master who has always marched to his own flute. So it&#039;s almost fitting that he&#039;s forgoing a much-rumored Led Zeppelin reunion tour in order to revive the band he fronted in the mid-Sixties. First time around, Band of Joy were a British blues-rock footnote. Now they&#039;re an American roots crew in which Plant shares vocal duties with alt-country star Patty Griffin. The first offering from Plant and Band of Joy&#039;s forthcoming album, "Angel Dance" is a bluegrass cover of a 20-year-old Los Lobos lullaby, with a sound that recalls Plant&#039;s Grammy-winning collaboration with Alison Krauss. Over some mandolin-picking and a fat, subtly distorted low end, Plant punctuates lyrics of fatherly self-assurance ("Goodbye, don&#039;t cry/Tomorrow, bring us a brand-new day") with classic predatoryaahsanduhhsstraight out of "Whole Lotta Love." The result is sweet, elegant NPR folk that still swings like Satan&#039;s barn door.

The xx
“Angels”
The Brit indie-pop trio float a naked lover&#039;s plea over moon-shadow shoegaze guitar. Romy Madley Croft seems strung between a breakup and a breakdown, yet totally in control of the moment.

Christina Perri
Arms
Matching the young-adult tumult of Kelly Clarkson with the wind-swept angst of Florence and the Machine, Perri&#039;s 2010 smash hit "Jar of Hearts" was bad-boyfriend-crushing piano pop &mdash; the kind of thing that you crank as you decide which local cliff to jump off when your high school love dumps you for a Cheerio. Her newest blast of feelings-napalm is a ballad that starts out placid and folky, then picks up intensity and volume, as grand melodic swooshes (and timpani!) imply romantic rapture between Perri and her new man. But watch out: Chrissy&#039;s valentine seems to come with a razor blade of crazy: "I can&#039;t make you bleed if I&#039;m alone." Dude, run.

Debo Band
Asha Gedawo
A Tune-Yards side project? No, but this Ethiopian-American crew&#039;s update on Seventies East African funk sounds just as giddily strange. Guitar solos, massed vocals,violin and brass rush in like a Red Bulled marching band. Dance at your own risk.

Ariel Pink&#039;s Haunted Graffiti
Baby
This low-fi popster&#039;s new one is a loving cover of the 1979 soul obscurity "Baby," cranking the trippiness in&nbsp;a ballad that was pretty codeine-dream trippy already.

Tom Waits
Bad As Me
What&#039;s that racket? A wounded beast bellowing over the primeval swamp? A circus band tumbling off a cliff? Oh, right &ndash; it&#039;s the newTom Waitssong. The kickoff to Waits&#039; forthcoming 17th studio album is a gloriously ramshackle thing, with pop&#039;s greatest living vaudevillian pushing his drunkard&#039;s bleat over a honking baritone sax and a clattering oompah beat. The lyrics are total nonsense, and pure genius: "I&#039;m the one with the gun/Most likely to run/I&#039;m the car in the weeds/If you cut me, I&#039;ll bleed/You&#039;re the same kind of bad as me."

Beck
Bad Blood
On this cut for the soundtrack to HBO&#039;sTrue Blood, Beck cranks out a swampy rock tune based around a filthy, Jack White-style garage riff. The reverb-dunked production adds a psychedelic edge — Beck hasn&#039;t sounded this bluesy or ramshackle in years.

M.I.A.
Bad Girls 
This repolished highlight fromM.I.A.&#039;sVicki Leekxmixtape still rides a slinky, Bollywood-style Danja beat, and the key line flips the emotional script: "I had a handle on it/My life, but I broke it." As anthems to recklessly empowered car sex go, surprisingly melancholy.

Miranda Lambert
Baggage Claim
The country fire-starter who brought you "Gunpowder &amp; Lead" gets back to what she does best: torching shit. Here, it&#039;s her needy man&#039;s baggage; putting it on the curb won&#039;t do. "Come and pick it up before I blow it up in flames," she belts. The emotional-baggage metaphor gets tortured, but the track is a funky country blues with aZeppelinmusk. Lambert simmers &ndash; a good-natured gal spitting hickory-smoked venom.

T.I. feat. Lil Wayne
Ball
On the new single off his forthcomingTrouble Man,T.I.&ndash; whose post-prison enterprises have included a crime novel and a role in the cable drama Boss &ndash; barrels for the dance floor, elbows flying. As contained and confident as ever, T.I. doesn&#039;t so much elaborate on the song&#039;s slogan ("This club so packed/These ho&#039;s so drunk") as let you know how at home he feels.

Young Jeezy feat. Lil Wayne
Ballin&#039;
Jeezy&#039;s last album was calledThe Recession. On his new single, the recovery is in full swing: "I&#039;m on them Diddys, spendin&#039; dirty money," he raps over a razor-sharp beat. Not to be out-balled,Weezyoffers, "So many cars, I&#039;m like, &#039;Eenie-meenie-minie-moe&#039;/So many colors in  the diamonds, kaleidoscope."

Interpol
Barricade
Funky in a pale, heart-wrenching sort of way, this new single mixes a propulsive backbeat with Paul Banks&#039; drama-packed moans about the fate of "thieves and snakes."

Ne-Yo
Beautiful Monster
There&#039;s a problem with Ne-Yo&#039;s girlfriend. "You&#039;re a knife, sharp and deadly," he sings. In lieu of couples therapy, superproducers Stargate lend a jittery Euro-house beat. It&#039;s more goofy than scary, but Ne-Yo&#039;s so amiable you root for him — to find a nicer gal, at least.

Soundgarden
Been Away Too Long
"You can&#039;t go home," Chris Cornell warns in a loose, blues-beast yowl. That sentiment might&#039;ve applied to "Live to Rise," the soft-bellied song Soundgarden lodged on the Avengers soundtrack. But the newest offering from their first studio LP in 16 years is a spry sludge slide worthy of that stank-caked legacy. The band&#039;s grunge-defining molten swing isn&#039;t airtight yet; it&#039;s more like someone poked the crankiest troll under the filthiest bridge in Seattle and he&#039;s waking up to stomp the day.

The Pains of Being Pure at Heart
Belong
The jangly rockers pump themselves into shoegazing superheroes on the title track of their new LP. Credit for the tidal-wave guitars is partly due to the production team of Flood and Alan Moulder, who recall the latter&#039;s own work with My Bloody Valentine. Hail the Nineties revival!

Beyonce
Best Thing I Never Had
"You showed your ass, and baby, I saw the real you,"Beyonc&eacute;&nbsp;sings with monsoon fury on her new single, giving the Real Housewives of R&amp;B the perfect pinot-grigio-powered bomb to drop before sending a 9-iron through his windshield. "Best Thing" is a welcome blast of sass after the niceties of "1 + 1." Co-written by Babyface, its balladic surge promises sunshine and unicorns, but B turns it on its ear with man-strafing soul venom; she even yanks the line "sucks to be you right now" from the bottom of theKelly Clarkson/Katy Perry castoff pile and makes it breathe fire.

Teen
Better
Three sisters plus a pal (convened by Teeny Lieberson of dreamy indie poppers Here We Go Magic) cook up some darkly pulsating basement New Wave rapture. The song was produced by Sonic Boom of Eighties indie-psych gods Spacemen 3, upping its retro-salvage appeal even further.

Eddie Vedder
Better Days
This spare slow-burner had Pearl Jam scholars wondering whether it was aRiot ActorBackspacerouttake. Turns out it&#039;s Vedder&#039;s contribution to theEat Pray Lovesoundtrack, though it would have been a quiet standout on any recent PJ album.

Adam Lambert
Better Than I Know Myself
Romantic angst, "Glambert" style - that is, a wind-whipped mid-tempo ballad,&nbsp;produced by Claude Kelly and the inevitable Dr. Luke and designed to&nbsp;showcaseLambert&#039;s superhuman vocal range. It&#039;s formulaic pap, but just you&nbsp;wait for the money-shot falsetto in the chorus.

Rihanna Feat. Chris Brown 
Birthday Cake (Remix)
The musical reconciliation of Rihanna and Chris Brown raises a welter of emotions: outrage, sadness, bewilderment, revulsion. It&rsquo;s not merely, as some armchair psychoanalysts have suggested, evidence of crippling codependency; nor is it solely a morally obtuse publicity stunt. It&rsquo;s business as usual, consistent with the music that has made Rihanna a prolific hitmaker: From "Breakin&rsquo; Dishes: to "S&amp;M," her songs explore the violence of sex and, yes, the sexiness of violence. "Turn Up the Music" is proforma club R&amp;B that spices up Brown&rsquo;s simpering lead vocals with some flirty cooing from Rihanna. Her "BirthdayCake" is a more sonically arresting piece, a raucous mix of buzzes, beats and X-rated chants. Brown announces,"I wanna fuck you right now"; Rihanna ups the ante by turning sex into a power play: "I&rsquo;m-a make you my bitch." Is it coincidence that Rihanna is the dominatrix, and Brown the submissive who gets crushed beneath her leatherboot heel? The revenge is symbolic, of course. Unfortunately, symbolic victories are the only kind available to Rihanna &ndash; and evidently, they&rsquo;re the kind she cares about most.

2 Chainz feat. Kanye West
Birthday Song
"All I want for my birthday is a big booty call,"&nbsp;Atlanta rapper 2 Chainz barks on his new single, underscoring his zest for rap&#039;s simple pleasures &ndash; a slinky strip-club beat, a burial plot in the jewelry store and a hyped-upKanye Westcameo. "Birthday Song" doesn&rsquo;t have the casual brilliance of his 2011 hit "I Spent It," but 2 Chainz is clearly cut from the Lil Jon/Waka Flocka Flame mold, where good-natured charisma can trump talent.

Tune-Yards
Bizness
One-woman art-pop tempest Merrill Garbus crafts an awesome collage of African rhythms and hip-shaking horns. Garbus&#039; vocals conjure both Odetta and Janis Joplin, if they&#039;d had looping software.

Soundgarden
Black Rain
Cut in 1991 but never released (it&#039;ll be on Soundgarden&#039;s forthcoming best-of), this grunge nugget finds Chris Cornell rocking like Sammy Hagar on a three-state killing spree. Obscure demo? No way — this burns as much flannel as anything in their canon.

Lana Del Rey feat. Azealia Banks
Blue Jeans (Smims and Belle remix)
The original was a nice idea &ndash;ZZ Top&#039;s "Sharp Dressed Man" made into a trip-hop ballad, even if Del Rey is too thin a singer to pull it off. This remix proves you can save anything with the right flavor of disco thwump and a tight freestyle &ndash; in this case, from hip-hop comer Azealia Banks, who storms in blazing hotter than Jamaica.

Big Baby Gandhi feat. Das Racist
Blue Magic
Riding with Queens buddies Das Racist, this 21-year-old "terrorist with no turban, lyricist with no sermon" sounds both skilled and spazzy over a dope, Zenned-out groove. "Y&#039;all sound like Coldplay/Y&#039;all sound like Oprah," he yelps. "Me, I sound so dope-rah."

Beck
Blue Randy
IsJack Whitehiding a time machine at Third Man Records HQ? That&#039;s the only logical explanation for this White-produced one-off, in whichBeckis transformed into a zooted prankster. The A side is a smirking Nashville pastiche ("I just started wanting to punch your face/You might want to wear a helmet just in case"); "Blue Randy" finds Beck sighing sad tales of laser tag over burnt-caramel steel guitar. If the jokes made more sense, they wouldn&#039;t be half as funny.

Jack White
Blues on Two Trees
Take a victory lap,Jack&ndash; you&#039;ve just come up with the meanest, most riotously fucked-up thing of your career: The B side to "Shakin&#039;" is a goth-blues funeral processional shambling through a banshee forest of cackle and drone. The stumble-stomp drumming falls apart beautifully, and White&#039;s witchy-boy singing is genuinely unhinged: "Why don&#039;t you leave me alone and love a tree!" he shouts. White may be down on love, but at least he&#039;s eco-friendly.

Liz Phair
Bollywood
Is Liz Phair serious? As tabla-laden electro tinkles behind her, Phair tells a tale of music-biz misadventure, "rapping" in a voice that sounds like a soccer mom impersonating Ke$ha. The results are an insult to rappers everywhere, even the terrible ones.

Childish Gambino
Bonfire
Donald Glover would like you to start taking him seriously as a rapper. On his new single, the Community star reels off cheeky one-liners, mostly about how often he gets laid. His flow shamelessly mimicsLil Wayne&#039;s, but then again, it&#039;s been a while since Weezy sounded this hungry.

Prince
Bonus Track #77
Having declared the Internet "over," Prince is releasing his new disc by giving it away in copies of European newspapers and magazines, such asRolling Stone&#039;s German edition and Belgium&#039;s enticingly namedHet Nieuws&shy;blad. Sadly, 20Ten is all blad and no nieuws, wanly recapitulating Purple Rain&#039;s funk-rock sound while replacing its great theme (fucking) with windy lyrics about universal wisdom. Fitting the offbeat marketing plan, the best song is a hidden track, "Laydown," a hypnotic grind with big, scratchy riffs and a sing-rap cadence weirdly reminiscent of Missy Elliott&#039;s "Get Ur Freak On." It&#039;s Prince at his most playful, inviting us to his righteous planet with abstruse poetry: "From the heart of Minnesota/Here come the Purple Yoda." (Shouldn&#039;t that be "The Purple Yoda, from the heart of Minnesota here come"?) It&#039;s a welcome break from all the heavy thinking, and it&#039;s full of something too many recent Prince songs have lacked: fun.

Lady Gaga
Born This Way
Click to listen to Lady Gaga&#039;s "Born This Way"

Sleigh Bells
Born to Lose
The adorable Brooklyn duo&#039;s 2010 debut was all slashing, distortion-mad&nbsp;riffs and bubblegum sass. The new single from their forthcoming LP is a&nbsp;dreamier beast, letting punk-rock cheerleader chants take a backseat to&nbsp;swaying shoegaze beauty that recalls &#039;90s bands like Lush and Curve. &nbsp;It&#039;s a&nbsp;sweet step forward.

Justin Bieber
Boyfriend
Justin Bieber has called "Boyfriend," the first single from his forthcoming albumBelieve, "hater-proof." But how can a song that begins with Bieber rapping in his thickest patois about his "swag" not be hater-bait? With a taut, funky beat by Mason D. Levy and Mike Posner and a lyric that mixes kiddie-movie references ("I could be your Buzz Lightyear"), chivalry ("I can be a gentleman") and hip-hop braggadocio ("Chillin&#039; by the fire while we eatin&#039; fondue"), the song is expertly calculated to ease the Biebs&#039; transition from tweenpop dreamboat to post-tweenpop dreamboat. The subtext is clear: Justin Has Actually Had Sexual Intercourse &ndash; But He Won&#039;t Harm Your Nine-Year-Old. "Hater-proof"? Try foolproof.

Florence and the Machine
Breath of Life
Inspired by Charlize Theron&#039;s evil-queen character in the new Snow White movie, this song from the film&#039;s soundtrack is Flo at her most toweringly gothed-out. All doom-drum rush and endless-midnight orchestral sweep, it sounds like it was produced by Sauron the Dark Lord of Mordor &ndash; but in a good way. The wintry tumult sets the stage for a display of primal vocal acrobatics and white-knuckled emoting. Flo goes looking for "a little touch of heavenly light/But all the choirs in my head say &#039;no.&#039;" And they sure say it loud. Someone get that girl an Advil.

Scott Weiland
Breathe
Smooth and warm-hued, this monster ballad &ndash; from theAvengerssoundtrack &ndash; could be a fossil encased in amber. In fact, it&#039;s an ode to numbness: "You... erase away the black and white," Weiland croons over cock-rock guitar. It&#039;s almost heartbreaking.

Arctic Monkeys
Brick By Brick
The first taste of the Brit band&#039;s fourth LP, this oddly meat-and-potatoes rocker finds Alex Turner rhyming "rock &amp; roll" with "steal your soul" over simple riffs. His Jim Morrison impression later in the song is only a minor improvement.

Jai Paul
BTSTU (edit)
"Don&#039;t fuck with me," coos this 22-year-old in a parched Smokey Robinson falsetto, until a dirty, throbbing synth pulse sweeps in, rendering more nuanced emotion unintelligible. It&#039;s the first single from a U.K. laptop-rocking soulman (see:James Blake) whose forthcoming LP should melt both hearts and brains.

50 Cent and David Guetta
Bullshit &amp; Party
50 Cent goes Eurotrash: The refrain is from Biggie Smalls, but French DJ Guetta&#039;s insipid house beat and 50&#039;s dull rhymes ("Let&#039;s make a toast/To success/You&#039;re my guest/I&#039;m your host") could only seem funky in the discoth&egrave;que of a Riviera budget hotel.

Linkin Park
Burn It Down
On the first single fromLinkin Park&#039;s forthcomingLiving Things, Chester Bennington unpacks, yet again, his propensity for screwing things up. Before zooming into the anguished yowl we&#039;ve come to demand of a Linkin Park chorus, Bennington delivers some of his prettiest verses ever &ndash; and he does it over a burbling synth groove that wouldn&#039;t be out of place in an industrial-friendly rave. (Mike Shinoda is, per Linkin Park tradition, on hand for a quickie run of unassuming rhymes.) There&#039;s a certain poetry to the "Burn It Down" approach, which draws a sharp line between the smooth and the rough &mdash; and leaves open the option&nbsp;of just dancing the night away. In the end, the fire down below comes out&nbsp;on top.&nbsp;

Chelsea Light Moving
Burroughs
WithSonic Youthstill on vacation, Thurston Moore has formed a new band comprised of Northhampton, Mass cronies to play what he calls "Burroughs rock." Lucky for us, our first taste of this exciting new genre sounds quite a lot like vintage Sonic Youth (sort ofSister&#039;s "Stereo Sanctity" meetsDaydream Nation&#039;s "Hey Joni") &ndash; a loose, breakneck gallop, waves of two-guitar noise-terror and a fired-up Moore singing a tribute in the form of a playful punk-rock taunt. After the refined, largely acoustic craftsmanship of his 2011 solo album, it&rsquo;s nice to hear him inducing some migraines again.

EMA
California
EMA &mdash; a.k.a. Erika M. Anderson &mdash; chants a love-hate letter to the state that&#039;s "so fucked it&#039;s 5150," complete with crashing piano chords and dirty synth drones. She&#039;s like the bastard daughter of Sin&eacute;ad O&#039;Connor, except twice as crazy and six times as funny.

Delta Spirit
California
"I want you to move to California. . . . But not for me," Matt Vasquez sings over synth-rock swirls. It&#039;s a far cry from the band&#039;sFriday Night Lightsfolk benediction, "Devil Knows You&rsquo;re Dead," but Vasquez&#039;s warm West Coast vocals make the unvite seem like an act of kindness.

Katy Perry feat. Snoop Dogg
California Gurls
Conceived as an answer to Jay-Z&#039;s "Empire State of Mind," this ode to West Coast ladies is gleefully over-the-top — a thumping, synthy summer anthem that screams, "This is a summer anthem!" Snoop Dogg&#039;s lyrics are marginally better than Perry&#039;s lines about "Sippin&#039; on gin and juice/Laying under the palm trees," and you can bet your SPF 80 that the buoyant tune (co-penned by Dr. Luke and Max Martin) will lodge itself in millions of skulls.

Miley Cyrus
Can&#039;t Be Tamed
Miley Cyrus: America&#039;s teen sweetheart, or God&#039;s gift to vice-squad sting operations? TheHannah Montanagal goes for a grown-up club sound, with Rihanna-style robot-disco thump and boy-crazy AutoTune vocals about how hot she is. She boasts, "I always get a 10, &#039;cause I&#039;m built like that." If she gets a 10, what does he get — 15 to 20? It&#039;s no "Party in the USA" or "See You Again," but the chorus packs plenty of electro-fizz pizzazz.

Teddybears feat. Robyn
Cardiac Arrest
While her fellow Swedes Teddybears make frothy disco rock, Robyn coyly disses a drugged-up young woman. Call it a pinch of arsenic in a tequila shot.

The xx
Chained
This second track fromthe xx&#039;s forthcoming second album plays Oliver Sim&#039;s vocals off Romy Madley-Croft&#039;s, and the result is likeMarvin Gayeand Tammi Terrell circling each other in a space station, uniting only for the relationship post-mortem hook: "We used to get closer than this/Is it something you miss?" Jamie XX&#039;s sleight-of-hand minimalism &ndash; the off-beat kick drum, the thunder-rumble ride cymbal, the rimshot syncopation &ndash; is no less intoxicating; at present he may be the most elegant beatmaker in pop. That they also have the best haircuts in indie rock hardly matters.

Coldplay
Charlie Brown
These new songs &ndash; all debuted live in recent months but not yet released in studio versions &ndash; suggestColdplay&#039;sforthcoming album may be more gritty, fun, strange and (yes) danceable than any so far: aZooropato theUnforgettable Fireof 2008&#039;sViva la Vida. "Hurts Like Heaven" opened their Lollapalooza set with a word rush that occasionally recalledLCD Soundsystem&#039;s"All My Friends," plus some outstanding guitar asides. Broadcast on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, "Charlie Brown" (not the Coasters&#039; 1959 hit, alas) triangulatesSpringsteen,U2andArcade Firein a hood-rat oratorio that roars even if Chris Martin&#039;s delivery feels too genteel. "Us Against the World" (debuted at the Rock am Ring festival in Germany) is an anthemic ballad with sweet harmony vocals from drummer/secret weapon Will Champion. Most interesting may be "Princess of China," with a dubby drum track so huge, it apparently blew out all the bootleggers&#039; mics in Nuremberg.

Yuck
Chew
These U.K. kids unspool a hymn to theSmashing Pumpkinsschool of slacker grandiosity. From the chorus &ndash; "We chew it together," where the "chew" might as well be a slurred "do" &ndash; to the warmly melancholic tone of the big guitar solo, it sounds like Clinton-era gold.

Dr. Dre feat. Swizz Beatz
Chillin&#039; 
The last leak from Dre&#039;s eternally forthcoming Detox was "I Need a Doctor," a hard-rocker featuring Eminem that made Dre&#039;s return seem not just imminent but urgent. With "Chillin&#039; " (as yet unconfirmed forDetox), Dre returns to hislaaaaaid-backcomfort zone (&agrave; la late-2010&#039;s "Kush"). Riding a percolating groove, it&#039;s serviceably succulent loungin&#039;-in-the-club funk. But, c&#039;mon, Dre. "Kush"? "Chillin&#039; "? We get it. You like to relax. But could you maybe crank it up a notch?

Kanye West
Christmas In Harlem
Kanye&#039;s tinsel-tinted stocking stuffer sounds uncharacteristically tossed-off, as if he&#039;s preoccupied with the Xmas shopping spree he says he&#039;s planning. But actual Harlem R&amp;B hopeful Teyana Taylor offers warmth from the wind chill, eventually slipping into the comfy melody from the Brothers Johnson&#039;s "Strawberry Letter 23." And gruff-rapping Atlanta Santa CyHi Da Prynce promises presents for non-Christian kiddies, too &mdash; hauled in a Porsche-speed sleigh.

My Morning Jacket
Circuital
A shimmering curtain of Eno-incensed atmospherics, a muted kick drum, a dry guitar figure. Then Jim James, dressed in reverb, declares he is "going back to my childhood way." And so he does on a track that recalls 2001&#039;sAt Dawnmore than 2008&#039;s genre-hoppingEvil Urges: Vigorous acoustic strumming teases an arena crescendo, drops out for a verse, then all the guitars kick in, classicMMJwith a dash of the Edge and a dollop ofNeil Young. The title track of the forthcoming LP will be a live burner, no doubt. Here, it&#039;s a philosophical stalemate whose sonic bliss-out feels too short, even at seven-plus minutes. But it&#039;s still plenty blissful.

Justice
Civilization
The first single from the French electronic duo&#039;s long-awaited second album delivers a high- end baguette beat-down &mdash; it&#039;s a blistering track, partDaft Punk&#039;s "Aerodynamic," partthe Who&#039;s "Baba O&#039;Riley," and totally over-the-top.

The Hives
Civilization&#039;s Dying
The monochromatically dressed Swedes return with this cover of a 1981 tune by the Indianapolis punk band Zero Boys. The Hives&#039; version is more polished than the original, but it&#039;s still as blazing as a rant about the world going to hell in a handbasket ought to be. Howlin&#039; Pelle Almqvist lives up to his nickname as he spits lyrics like "Civilization&#039;s crying/And I won&#039;t try to deny it/We got a problem, son/Something&#039;s gotta be done." Sounds like he&#039;s as angry over Dina leavingRHNJas we are.

Usher
Climax
Quiet storm gets a freaky sci-fi makeover on the Diplo-produced "Climax," which sets Usher&rsquo;s plaintively pleading falsetto atop a shape-shifting landscape of clicks, hisses, whooshes and bass-y synth gurgles. The title suggests a booty-call anthem, and while the lush sound might have its uses in the boudoir, this is really a breakup lament. "Where are you now, when I need you around?/I&#039;m on my knees, but it seems we&rsquo;re going nowhere fast/We&#039;ve reached the climax," Usher concedes, grieving for a relationship that&#039;s passed the point of no return.&nbsp;

Death Cab For Cutie
Codes and Keys
This new ballad (heard here in a live, solo-piano version) proudly bites Leonard Cohen&#039;s "Hallelujah." Ben Gibbard follows minor falls and major lifts to the cold and broken refrain, "We are a-live" &mdash; sounding both fragile and optimistic.

Bon Iver
Come Talk To Me
This B side revives a 1992Peter Gabrieloriginal with acoustic banjo plucks and Justin Vernon&#039;s layered cries. When Vernon sings, "The heart, it will not be denied/Till we&#039;re both on the same damn side," and summons the yearning chorus, it&#039;s damn near unearthly.

Mazzy Star
Common Burn
The Los Angeles duo&#039;s first single in 15 years is pure country-rock haze: nodding harmonica, shivering electric guitar and Hope Sandoval&#039;s voice &ndash; angel, lover, hallucination of your mom speaking to you in utero. It&#039;s like they never left.

Bright Eyes
Coyote Song
A benefit single for the victims of Arizona&#039;s immigration laws, this protest song (about a lover stuck in Mexico) is as pretty as it is angry.

G-Dragon
Crayon
A smashing synthesis of pidgin rap, EDM head rush and YOLO &#039;tude: The token "pretty boy" rapper from K-pop crossover comers Big Bang drops a Joker laugh line ("Why so serious?") and a Kanye contraction ("cray") over a zooming Seoul nightclub beat, for a Korean-English mishmash that scans like an international student&#039;s peak-hour Facebook feed.

Brandon Flowers
Crossfire
In the genius video for the first single from Flowers&#039; solo debut, Charlize Theron rescues him from evil ninjas, showing off her throwingstar chops and flashing him a brilliant, you-are-so-high-maintenance glare before she cuts him free. Sadly, it&#039;s wasted on a song that sounds like a Killers B side — standard-issue Boss-meets-Bono dance rock, with Flowers serving up so much meteorological-metaphor fury, you&#039;ll want to call FEMA: "Dark clouds roll their way over town/Heartache and pain came a-pouring down like hail, sleet and rain."

Teddybears feat. the Flaming Lips
Crystal Meth Christian
Swedish beatmasters (and Robyn producers) cook up warm, gurgling funk while the Lips&#039; Wayne Coyne gets nasty, telling the titular Christian, "You take a diamond and make it sand."

Mastodon
Curl of the Burl
The ambitious prog-metal warriors, usually known for their long, shape-shifting compositions, pack their attack into a three-minute-plus brute rocker about tripping out on a tree knot (or something). The muscle is there, but it&#039;s kind of like Godzilla in a tuxedo.

MNDR
Cut Me Out
New York electro-pop duo Amanda Warner and Peter Wade mix warm synth beats with a soaring chorus that sounds like what birds must be thinking. The fantastically bespectacled Warner manages the impossible: Gearheads and hipsters swoon.

The Decemberists
Cuyahoga
The Decemberists-R.E.M. lovefest continues with one of the latter&#039;s great sleepers (fromLife&#039;s Rich Pageant), covered live forMorning Becomes Eclectic. Pretty faithful &mdash; except for Jenny Conlee&#039;s accordion, which adds a gentlebrauhausbounce. How about a dual tour? Please?

The Roots
Dear God 2.0
"This moody jam remakes the Monsters of Folk gospel-soul joint, adding fat ?uestlove beats and Black Thought&#039;s missive to God: "They said, &#039;He&#039;s busy, hold the line, please.&#039;" Maybe try Twitter?

Lloyd feat. Lil Wayne and Andre 3000
Dedication to My Ex (Miss That)
Lloyd&#039;s "Dedication to My Ex" could be 2011&#039;s "Fuck You" &ndash; the crazy catchy, joyfully profane, vaguely retro R&amp;B song that sweeps the internet. Over a slinky, organ-splashed groove that could have come from a Raphael Saadiq album (orFrat Rock!), Lloyd bemoans an unfaithful lady while his backup singers unleash an extremely grandma-unfriendly refrain: "I miss that pussy, that pussy, that pussy, that pussy!" Andre 3000&#039;s cameo, packed with slick wordplay and delivered in a relaxed, behind-the-beat attack, sounds killer. The end result makes sexual angst sounds like hot fun on a Friday night; credit everyone involved (including producer Polow da Don) that the 200 or so mentions of "pussy" is only one reason among several that "Dedication to My Ex (Miss That)" is notable. Lord knows what they&#039;ll do for a "clean" version.

DJ Shadow
Def Surrounds Us
After secretly planting vinyl copies in record shops across Europe, the master of surreal, sample-drenched electronica drops a digital version of this single, his first in four years. It&#039;s a time-warping combo of hand claps, video-game bleeps, Nineties jungle break beats and a slow-mo electric-guitar arpeggio, all unspooling amid snippets of the spoken phrase &quot;Though we are alive, death surrounds us.&quot; (Thanks for the reminder, Mr. Brightside!) &quot;I&#039;ve Been Trying,&quot; the psych-folk-soul B side, deepens the trance. Good to have you back, Swami.

Ryan Bingham and the Dead Horses
Depression
Bingham and producer T Bone Burnett — who together won an Oscar for co-writing "The Weary Kind" for Crazy Heart — reconvened for Bingham&#039;s Junky Star LP. The first single is about a jobless romantic who refuses to crack: "I&#039;d rather lay down in a pine box," Bingham croaks, "than sell my heart to a fucking wasteland." Call it a modern Dust Bowl ballad — raw-boned heartache that&#039;s just right for these times.

Kanye West
Devil in a New Dress
First he apologized to Taylor Swift. Now the contrite-Kanye trend continues on this bit of gorgeously swirling soul. Kanye confesses to being an asshole, then calls himself &quot;the LeBron of rhyme.&quot; A year ago that would&#039;ve been a boast, now it&#039;s an ironic wake-up call.

Rihanna
Diamonds
Chris Martin took to Twitter to declare Ri-Ri&#039;s newest one of his "favourite songs." Not a shock: It&#039;s very close to Coldplay soul, a striking turn into lustrous power balladry after a string of filthed-up R&amp;B sexcapades. Written by arty Aussie diva Sia and produced by Benny Blanco and Norwegian hitmaker Stargate, it&#039;s glassily curvaceous and strikingly spare: "Find light in the beautiful sea/I choose to be happy," she sings over an ice-flow piano and cascading beat. If she really has started things back up with that other Chris, then this hits the perfect, vaguely creepy note of against-the-odds hope for the occasion.

Justin Bieber
Die in Your Arms
Released just days after he allegedly up and decked a pesky paparazzi, the second single from Justin Bieber&#039;s forthcoming Believe follows the self-described "swag" of "Boyfriend" with a more subtle moonwalk down the fault line between teddy bear andTimberlake. Over bubblegum-sweet hip-hop bounce, neosoul piano flourish and a flower-bearing snatch of organ, Bieber tries on aYoung Michaelplea as he begs, "Teach me to behave" and "Promise you won&#039;t keep me waiting," with butterfly grace. It&#039;s the sound of Bieber rounding third base, custom-made to get played in Mom&#039;s minivan on the way to Little League practice.

R.E.M.
Discoverer
Peter Buck&#039;s psychedelic guitar intro gives a tantalizing taste of the new-model R.E.M. &mdash; like Jefferson Airplane circaSurrealistic Pillowcovering Sonic Youth&#039;s "Eric&#039;s Trip." A track from the eagerly awaitedCollapse Into Now(due in March), "Discoverer" has the widescreen presence of R.E.M. classics likeNew Adventures in Hi-Fi. But when Michael Stipe bellows, "Hey, baby, this is not a challenge," you don&#039;t believe it.

Santigold
Disparate Youth
On her 2008 debut, Santi White synthesized New Wave, post-punk, pop and dancehall strains into her own new flavor of downtown cool. She&#039;s at it again on the first single from her long-gestating follow-up &ndash; a slippery earworm that opens with airy digital fanfare reminiscent of Drake&#039;s triumphalTake Carecut "Headlines," before falling into a dark, post-dub groove that&#039;s altogether sexier and more conflicted. "We know now we want more/A life worth fighting for," she purrs over panicky percussion and machine-gun bass &ndash; a revolutionary anthem for a frustrated generation.&nbsp;

Ivy
Distant Lights

Jessie J
Do It Like a Dude
Jessie J is no girly girl &mdash; she&#039;s a Brit newcomer who wears her hat low and often avoids pants. The 22-year-old already has a sugary hit on her resume (she co-penned Miley&#039;s "Party in the U.S.A."), but on her debut single she her stomps her way across the pond, presumably with tongue in cheek: "Do It Like a Dude" finds her grabbing her crotch and dropping MF-bombs over rock riffs while calling her girls "sugar" and throwing in a brawling pop chorus. Fierce!

Ane Brun
Do You Remember
Norwegian singer-songwriter Ane Brun (who toured withPeter Gabrielin 2009) is typically a rustic acoustic type. But on this knockout single, Brun hires three Burundi-style drummers who turn her elegy to a finished romance into something that feels more deeply haunted. When she finishes with a flat, "The last time you&#039;d be mine," followed by a dead stop, it&#039;s positively unsettling.

NKOTBSB
Don&#039;t Turn Out the Lights
To boy-band fans, New Kids on the Block getting together with theBackstreet Boysis like Moses teaming up with Jesus. And the gut-sucking supergroup&#039;s debut track is blue-eyed dance-pop whoosh. Every Boy and Kid gets a piece of the vocals, and we get a piece of the dream.

The Rolling Stones
Doom and Gloom
The Stones&#039; first new studio recording since 2005&#039;sA Bigger Bangopens as expected &ndash; with the rough, lowdown stammer ofKeith Richards&#039; guitar &ndash; and moves like old times, propelled by the straight, brisk swing of drummer Charlie Watts. "Doom and Gloom" is also grimly perfect for this election season, like a tough-bastard spawn of "Start Me Up" crossed with the hard red rain of "Too Much Blood."Mick Jaggersnarls and sneers through a long list of bad mojo &ndash; including zombies, wartime, eco-armegeddon and drunk assholes on planes &ndash; taking only a quick break at the end of the chorus for some dancing in the ruins. He spends more time, in the second verse, squeezing every drop of bitterness from the word "screws." "Doom and Gloom," produced by Don Was, is unusually stark for a Stones single &ndash;&nbsp;all pulse and paranoia, peppered with Ron Wood&#039;s short feral barks of lead guitar. But it sticks to your skin like chicken wire.

Amadou &amp; Mariam
Dougou Badia
Motherland, meet Brooklyn. Santigold and theYeah Yeah Yeahs&#039; Nick Zinner get down with Mali&#039;s Afro-pop ambassadors, and the ladies own the mics while the dudes plow fields with their electric guitars. If the stormy jam at the end went on for 10 more minutes, there&rsquo;d be no complaints here.

The Decemberists
Down by the Water
Surprise! This isn&#039;t an 18-minute prog epic. Instead, it&#039;s a tight folk rocker from the Decemberists&#039; forthcoming album,The King Is Dead. R.E.M.&#039;s Peter Buck adds signature guitar chime, Gillian Welch contributes powerhouse backing vocals, and there&#039;s also a badass harmonica-accordion duel. It&#039;s not entirely clear what frontman Colin Meloy is going on about, but his imagery is evocative. About this "lash-flashing Leda of Pier 19," sir, we would like to hear more.

Chieftains feat. Bon Iver
Down in the Willow Garden 
The Celtic traditionalists and the cathedral-folk troubador get together for some creepily beautiful murder ballad magic. Even when he&rsquo;s singing about sending a saber through his "dear little girl," Justin Vernon&rsquo;s immolating mumble-croon can convince you he&rsquo;s the victim, and the Chieftains&rsquo; lithe pipes and fiddles give his dark twisted fantasy enough Irish spring to put it over.

Kurt Vile
Downbound Train
Reviving the darkest moment fromBruce Springsteen&#039;sBorn in the U.S.A.for his new EP, Vile wraps the tune in a shitstorm of electric guitars and reverb, slurring the tale of hard times and heartbreak like a guy who diligently self-medicates before heading off to Occupy Wall Street.

Gorillaz feat. Andre 3000 and James Murphy
DoYaThing
LCD Soundsystem mastermind James Murphy will soon be marketing his own espresso blend, and he probably blazed up a blammo batch of it for this zippy future-freak soul summit. Putting this many visionary types in one studio could&rsquo;ve made for a mess, but they lock in for a three-man weave &ndash; like the Bird-McHale-Parish of avant-R&amp;B. Damon Albarn lays down a double-time funk&nbsp;charge and lyrical patter about being a "pale imitator of a boy in the sky," while Murphy unspools tweak-y falsetto silliness and Andre 3000 drops a devastating freestyle &ndash; "I&rsquo;m anOutkastbut you&rsquo;re into me/Summer got mad &#039;cause winter blew me" &ndash; before taking us to the rivers of Mars like a sweetly zonkedAl Green. The comedown from this must&#039;ve been brutal.

Travie McCoy
Dr. Feel Good
A sticky-sweet summer confection if ever there was one, this highlight from Gym Class Heroes frontman Travie McCoy finds him teaming up with Gnarls Barkley&#039;s Cee-Lo Green and dishing out whipcrack, mile-a-minute raps between Lo&#039;s high-gliding, R&amp;B vocal hook. "Dr. Feelgood" is a brisk, funky number, punctuated by tight guitar stabs and bright blasts of organ. Considering McCoy&#039;s addiction to painkillers, which he&#039;s since kicked, it&#039;s a bit odd to hear him rapping,&nbsp;"She&#039;s got a set of lips like a sedative/and every time I kiss, it&#039;s like medicine." Who&#039;s the femme fatale who could inspirethatconflicted analogy?

Ice Cube
Drink the Kool-Aid
In the video, Cube wears a T-shirt with a gangsta-fied Kool-Aid smiley face — a great metaphor for his journey from N.W.A to TBS. The gutbucket beat is crackin&#039;, but Cube wastes time dissing "young bucks" who might step up to him on the mic. That&#039;s beneath his stature.

Daft Punk
Drive
IfDaft Punkare theBeatlesof dance music, then this lost 1994 nugget &ndash; from a new compilation celebrating Scottish label Soma&#039;s 20th birthday &ndash; is their Cavern Club: all adrenaline, sweat and raw aggression. (Their Pete Best? A vintage Roland 909 drum machine, duh.) Don&#039;t expect any glitter-caked disco samples, though. Three years before their breakthrough LP,Homework(and way before the robot costumes and psychedelic pyramids), Daft Punk specialized in twisted, brutal jams made for big sound systems and dark rooms. Rave on.

LCD Soundsystem
Drunk Girls
LCD Soundsystem&#039;s cranky mastermind, James Murphy, is known for skewering his own hipster demographic — see 2002&#039;s music-snob-lampooning single, "Losing My Edge." But the dance-rock hero has never done it with the fierceness and catchiness he brings to "Drunk Girls," the first single from LCD&#039;s new album. It&#039;s Murphy&#039;s tightest, most accessible track yet — a four-minute disco party that brings together chugging guitar riffs, hand claps and shrieks, plus a rocket-propelled beat and a buoyant two-word hook ("Drunk girls!") that sounds vaguely Bowie-esque. Murphy needles party-hearty kids who might pack into a club only to "wait an hour to pee." But he also can&#039;t resist the allure of a pretty young thing, even if she is a bit wobbly: "I believe in waking up together/And so that means making eyes across the room," he croons on the sincere chorus. "Drunk Girls" isn&#039;t a reinvention for LCD Sound&shy;system, but it&#039;s sure to induce rampant fist-&shy;pumping from inebriates of both genders.

Paris Hilton
Drunk Text
Paris Hilton&#039;s "spoken word" "techno" "song," which leaked (or is it "leaked"?) earlier this week, is a tale of drunken clubbing drawled by the hotel heiress over a lame beat. There&#039;s Valley Girl beat poetry ("My mouth kept pouring desperate clauses of random intent"); there&#039;s words of wisdom ("No one is safe in the Twitter-sphere"). It&#039;s sublimely stupid &ndash; Hilton&#039;s greatest contribution to world culture by far. Her recording career should end now, while she&#039;s ahead.

Katy Perry
E.T. (feat. Kanye West)
The best thing about this version of Perry&#039;s leaden electro-pop jam is Yeezy flinging a pitch-shifted 16 before the song really begins &mdash; though rhyming "astronaut" with "get ass a lot," he sounds like he&#039;s checking his diamond-profile wristwatch.

Yoko Ono, Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon
Early in the Morning
This 14-minute track, also on 10-inch vinyl, is a benefit for orphans of the 2011 tsunami and a preview of a forthcoming album byOnoand theSonic Youthex-couple. Ono&#039;s tremolo cries are set in a guitar paroxysm recalling Youth&#039;s feedback monument "Expressway to Yr Skull." Gordon adds eerie alto-vocal comfort, while theJohn Lennonwho played on Ono&#039;s "Mind Train" would approve of the guitars&#039; treble stammers and raw-fuzz groans.

Ponytail
Easy Peasy
What are these Baltimore art-school punk kids on? A creative roll, for one thing. "Easy Peasy" is nearly six minutes of mayhem, mixing up King Crimson-style riffs, African soukous beats and New Wave synths, while Molly Siegel steals the show with her David Byrne-meets-Bikini Kill howl.

Michelle Mangione and Grace Slick
Edge of Madness 
A benefit track for victims of the BP oil spill, "Madness" begs for justice on behalf of the Gulf Coast over spry zydeco. Too bad Slick, Jefferson Airplane&#039;s grande dame, is barely audible.

Thom Yorke, Burial and Four Tet
Ego
Released on a limited-edition 12-inch single, "Ego" gives a taste of three great experimenters: underwater grooves (Burial), webs of acoustic instruments (Four Tet) and fidgety beats (Yorke). It&#039;s a dance-floor come-on by a dude who may over-think his morning oatmeal: "The daydreamers, the dope smokers, the loose talkers," Yorke sings, apparently listing his competition, "I bet they just throw themselves at you." As DJ supergroups go, promising indeed.

Bomba Estereo
El Alma y el Cuerpo
On the Colombian electro-cumbia crew&#039;s latest, Liliana Saumet mysticizes about her blood boiling over bobbing, arrhythmic guitar and synth haze. Sexy.

New Order
&#039;Elegia&#039; (long version)
"Elegia" first appeared in 1985 as a majestic five-minute waltz. The full version is a 17-minute-plus epic that threatens to fade, rebuilds around tortured guitar bursts, and gives up the ghost in a final feedback gasp. Unintelligible voices flicker, but what&#039;s being expressed is clearly beyond words.

Jane&#039;s Addiction
End to the Lies
Getting the newest edition ofJane&#039;s Addictionoff the ground hasn&#039;t been easy: FormerGuns n&#039; Rosesbassist Duff McKagan recently quit the band after just six months. He was replaced byTV on the Radiosound whiz Dave Sitek, whose art-dude mitts are all over the first track from the band&#039;s first album in eight years. Over a sleek bass line and shards of post-punk guitar noise, Perry Farrell fights to relocate his Eighties-shaman form, singing, "You only become more like yourself," and nearly proving it.

Duffy
Endlessly
The Welsh singer carries a lover&#039;s torch on the title track from her second album, sighing sweetly over spare acoustic guitars and suggesting early-Sixties soul at its warmest.&nbsp;

Aaliyah feat. Drake
Enough Said
Aaliyah fans reacted violently to the release of "Enough Said," in which a new beat, and some Drake rapping, are grafted to a vocal by the late singer. Drake&#039;s rap feels like a desecration: desultory boasting, pointless "wass ups," slapped on like gaudy graffiti tags. Airbrush out his contribution &ndash; the Web has already obliged &ndash; and it&#039;s an engrossing record, with eerily stark production from Noah "40" Shebib: a great fit, and a worthy tribute, to R&amp;B&#039;s most avant-garde diva.

Willis Earl Beal 
Evening&#039;s Kiss
An addictive slice of ultra-lo-fi soul-folk from this mysterious Chicago-based singer-songwriter, who&rsquo;s a self-styled outsider in the spirit of Wesley Willis and Daniel Johnston. "I&rsquo;m still disillusioned and cool catatonic/Always in a daze without smoking that chronic," Beal rhymes over spare acoustic guitar, sounding more like Cat Power than Snoop Dogg. Welcome to the new normal.&nbsp;

U2
Every Breaking Wave
U2 have made their current European tour a testing ground for new material. The best of the new live songs is &quot;Mercy,&quot; cut during the sessions for 2004&#039;sHow to Dismantle an Atomic Bombbut not on the album. The band has reworked &quot;Mercy&quot; for the stage, turning it into a big bear hug of a ballad that almost sounds like it could have gone onJoshua Tree.&quot;You&#039;re going to kill me, and I want to die,&quot; Bono sings against the Edge&#039;s spacey arpeggios. &quot;We were meant for each other.&quot; Other tracks that thrilled fans this summer include the intensely rocking &quot;Return of the Stingray Guitar,&quot; the psychedelic &quot;Glastonbury&quot; and the starkly beautiful &quot;Every Breaking Wave.&quot; The latter recalls &quot;All I Want Is You,&quot; with Bono delivering dark poetry like &quot;The waves know we&#039;re on the rocks/Drowning is no sin.&quot; U2 say they have four separate albums in the works; if so, this is a good start.

David Guetta and Alesso feat. Tegan and Sara
Every Chance We Get We Run
French DJ Guetta usually works with big rock and R&amp;B personalities, but on this bonus cut from the reissue of his 2011 LP, Canadian indie-pop duo Tegan and Sara&#039;s sheer, shy vocals give the Guettanator&#039;s airy thwump a brave new feel: subtle sensuality.

Coldplay
Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall
Chris Martin saysColdplay&#039;s upcoming album is influenced by old-school New York graffiti, and in a recent photo the bandmates are dressed in neon chillwear like they just walked off the set ofBreakin&#039; 3: A Brit-Pop Odyssey. But the first single doesn&#039;t go for the sound of early hip-hop so much as its sense of year-zero possibility. Over a rave-tinged keyboard melody, leavened by producer Brian Eno&#039;s rainforest-of-the-soul ambience, Martin sings of kids dancing until morning and heaven inside his headphones. When the drums kick in fully, it moves like "Sunday Bloody Sunday" by way of the Velvets&#039; "Sunday Morning," a flag-waving ode to change-as-inspiration: "I&#039;d rather be a comma than a full stop," Martin sings. Coming from a guy whose critics take him for a human exclamation point, it&#039;s a welcome sentiment.

Seu Jorje
Everybody Loves the Sunshine
The Brazilian singer with the killer Bowie covers (see The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou) wraps his chocolate baritone around this blissed-out &#039;76 Roy Ayers jam while Beastie Boys producer Mario Caldato Jr. makes the vintage synths sizzle like summer cicadas. More, please.

Ceremony
Everything Burns
Breakneck, brief and free of any unnecessary detailing, "Everything Burns" carries remnants of Ceremony&#039;s decade-old origins in severe California hardcore. But, appropriately, this shout-along alarm about the inevitability of change is also the catchiest song they&#039;ve recorded.

Sky Ferreira
Everything is Embarrassing
"Maybe if you let me be your lover," dance-pop shape-shifter Ferreira mumbles sexily over stark, twinkly electro, before adding forlornly, "But I would not bother"; it&#039;s just the kind of slow-burn zinger that can leave you drooling and crying at the same time.

Andrew Bird
Eyeoneye
Who pissed off Andrew Bird? "Go ahead and congratulate yourself," the normally &shy;mild-mannered Chicagoan snipes over surging guitars on this refreshingly sour preview of his new LP. Resentment suits Bird well &ndash; even his whistling sounds more urgent. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

James Blake and Bon Iver
Fall Creek Boys Choir
It&#039;s a match made in hipster heaven: The acclaimed electronica auteur teams up with the demigod of the beardy set. The result is gorgeous. On their first collaboration,James BlakeandBon Iverdip a stately gospel-soul ballad in Auto-Tune and that analog-tape-running-backward sucking sound. (And that barking noise is actually a Cu&iacute;ca drum.) You can&#039;t make heads or tails of Justin Vernon&#039;s lyrics, which may be a good thing given his usual poetastery. But meaning doesn&#039;t matter here&mdash;this is beauty for beauty&#039;s sake.

Bad Meets Evil
Fast Lane
"I hope that I don&#039;t sound too heinous when I say this, Nicki Minaj/But I wanna stick my pain-us in your anus,"Eminemrhymes on "Fast Lane." Oh, please, Em, you&#039;ve been way &shy;heinouser before. And, in fact, the track - the first single from Bad Meets Evil, the newly revived duo with his Detroit pal Royce da 5&#039;9" - is fired by mic-ninja rap attack, not jaundiced shock tactics. Eminem kicks it 1999-style, reconnecting with the hungry young lunatic who sounded like he only had a stanza to blow us away or it was back to the auto plant. Royce eggs him on with psycho shit like "Slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform...Hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn," and Shady returns to his 8 Mile roots: "Drive them trailer parks crazy/I am back, and I am razor-sharp, baby."

R. Kelly
Feelin&#039; Single
Kellyexacts revenge on a duplicitious lover with casual bonhomie: a disco pulse, horn blasts, and the nonchalant trill of a club‐hopping Casanova who could net 20 phone numbers by sunrise.

Hot Chip
Flutes
This dreamy extended workout by the British electro-pop act throws in dime-store synths, drum-machine thunderbolts and a sample from the titular instrument. But it doesn&#039;t hit its moody-disco mark until Alexis Taylor&#039;s haunted vocals kick in, casting a pall that can only be danced through.

Eminem
Fly Away
Why wasn&#039;t this fiery rant included on Eminem&#039;s last album? Unlike recent smashes "Not Afraid" and "Love the Way You Lie," this newly surfaced track (which didn&#039;t make the cut forRecovery) comes without any high concept &mdash; just Eminem spewing fantastic bile for five minutes. "I took a hiatus, haters, now I&#039;m back to cause trouble/Got the fuckin&#039; shape of mushroom clouds for thought bubbles," he fumes over producer Just Blaze&#039;s martial drum rolls and spare piano line. This is nu-Em at his finest, stone-cold sober but drunk on the sound of his own words. He&#039;s got his sense of humor back, too, livening up his vicious verses with a few decent scatological gags and a Brett Favre punch line. Even a flat-toned chorus sung by Blaze can&#039;t disrupt Eminem&#039;s focus. Just imagine how huge this could have been with a real hooksmith like Drake or Kid Cudi on the assist.

Courtesy of Pablo D&#237;az-Reixa, a Barcelona resident and rhythm-drunk sample chef, this dance track suggests Animal Collective with a taste for Spanglish R&amp;B. Pop a bottle of Cava for yourpapiand enjoy.

Tapes &#039;n Tapes
Freak Out
Like a blog-buzz phoenix, Minneapolis&#039; Tapes &#039;n Tapes tries rising again to the hype-making garage rock that first earned them Internet love five years ago. This galloping mix of distorted guitars and wild yelps is their strongest effort since.

Drake feat. Rick Ross
Free Spirit
Drake&#039;s latest is an irresistible sleaze-rap about the rapper&rsquo;s obsession with, well, tattooing his name on a young lady&rsquo;s body. The beat is appropriately moody and louche. (Dig that sax sample!) As for Rick Ross, his peccadilloes are even kinkier than Drake&#039;s: "I fondle the money, fornicate with a fortune."

Azealia Banks
Fuck Up the Fun
Good luck unpacking this warp-speed spit by Harlem&#039;s Banks, whose hungrily awaited debut LP is slated for fall. She informs us "my pussy&#039;s named Peach" (erm, TMI?) and sneers at "bitches . . . on&nbsp; YouTube, tryin&#039; to get y&#039;all little video views up to a million." Diplo&#039;s groove is a street fight between a marching band and a samba crew, and Banks doesn&#039;t miss a beat &ndash; or a beat-down.

Radiohead
Full Stop (live version)
Radiohead have been rolling out fascinating new material throughout their current tour &ndash; from the funeral-parlor soul ballad "Cut a Hole" to "Identikit," which suspended one of Thom Yorke&#039;s more athletic panic-attack falsetto freakouts over high-def funk burbles. The enthusiasm for this stuff among Radiohead fans is so intense that lyrics and guitar tabs for the most recent new offering, "Full Stop," were auctioned on eBay in March &ndash; three months before the band debuted the track on June 10th in Chicago. Like all their recent material, the song shows them continuing to futz brilliantly with the foreboding, groove-driven sound of last year&#039;sThe King of Limbs: Over a percolating beat and jarringly pretty, dawn-on-Hoth keyboard ghostliness, Yorke repeats, "The truth will mess you up," sort of like HAL 9000 with a new gig as the world&#039;s least helpful psychiatrist.

Dave Matthews Band
Gaucho
This mankind-will-self-destruct lament (fromDMB&#039;s upcoming, still-untitled album) offers a distinctly Dave-like blend of tension and uplift. Over a moody and elegant shuffle, Matthews sketches out the arc of civilization, from the invention of religion to the moon landing, and hints that the next leap won&#039;t derive from torching kind bud on Earth Day. And the inevitable children&#039;s choir? It works against a bridge that starts darkly atmospheric and crashes into jammy skronk. Let&#039;s see Jason Mraz pull that off.

Band of Horses
Georgia
Months after Cee Lo covered their slow-burn gem &quot;No One&#039;s Gonna Love You,&quot; Band of Horses step out of their bearded comfort zone with a charged-up version of the Lady Killer&#039;s homage to his home state. It&#039;s an indie-rock pep rally &mdash; backed by the University of Georgia marching band, no less.

Major Lazer
Get Free
Dirty Projectors&#039; Amber Coffman voices this dubby jam from Diplo&#039;s reggae project &ndash; a politicized lovers&#039; rock ballad evoking post-Katrina New Orleans. "Never got love from a government man/Headin&#039; downstream till the levee gives in," she coos. "Now we gotta swim." True, that.

Lykke Li
Get Some (Remix by Beck)
Beck hacks the groovy tribal single (by on-the-rise Swedish singer Lykke Li) into a spazzy collage with a shuffling beat, chunky power chords and vocals that head toward Bollywood.

Paul Simon
Getting Ready for Christmas Day
"Got a nephew in Iraq/It&#039;s his third time back," sings Paul Simon, pondering the fate of a relative spending Christmas abroad. "Jingle Bells" this ain&#039;t. The first taste of his forthcoming LP is built around a 1941 sample of the Rev. J.M. Gates (from the gospel compGoodbye, Babylon), and the end result recalls Simon&#039;s golden era, all warm tunefulness cut with mischief. "I may be layin&#039; in some lonesome grave," laments the Reverend. Then Simon&#039;s sunny chorus chases the blues away, at least for the moment.

Common feat. Nas
Ghetto Dreams
Rap-ignorant pundits should defame Common more often, if it&#039;ll result in  songs like this. The Chicago native&#039;s latest knocks harder than  anything on his last album, thanks to leering No I.D. production that  samples pre-funk George Clinton (the Parliaments&#039; "Let&#039;s Make It Last").  The song&#039;s around-the-way woman-worship ("Baby in one arm; the other is  a skillet") echoes that of "Fried Chicken" by Nas, who raps somewhat  reluctantly about "dimes" while touting his newly single status:  "African queen &mdash;yo, look at me, I&#039;m a bachelor!" Sean Hannity, get to misappropriating.

Mumford &amp; Sons
Ghosts That We Knew
Only a fool would mess with the formula that led to Mumford &amp; Sons&#039; junior-Coldplay coronation last year - and all signs indicate that the British alt-folk sensations have no intention of doing so on the follow-up to their sleeper smash debut LP,Sigh No More. Take their latest appetizer, a dolorous ballad that they previewed at a recent radio performance. "Ghosts That We Knew" (or maybe just "Ghosts") opens with soft acoustic fingerpicking and a typically careworn vocal from frontman Marcus Mumford: "You saw my pain washed out in the rain," he murmurs, bruised but still wanting to believe. His bandmates join in with ragged harmonies on the chorus - "I will hope as long as you like," Mumford pleads, "just promise me we&#039;ll be all right" - and their twangy contributions on banjo and accordion further the Appalachia-via-London catharsis. When Mumford&#039;s voice strains and sputters in the final refrain, it only makes him sound more passionate.

Madonna
Girl Gone Wild
Madge pissed offGirls Gone Wildscumtard Joe Francis with the title of her latest - and that isn&#039;t the only admirable thing about this return to the straight-ahead club trance she holds dear. Sure, as wildness goes it&#039;s closer toParks and Recreation&#039;s Leslie Knope thanBritney Spears, but the track (by Italian house producer Benny Benassi) smartly inverts the overpowering apocalypse pump of "Till the World Ends" into Euro-spa electro burble that&#039;s buoyant and warm-rinse soothing. It&#039;s the sound of a woman who hits the dancefloor for restoration more than craziness. After the "Mickey"-recalling head-scratcher of "Give Me All Your Luvin&#039;," it&#039;s nice to see her get back into the groove.&nbsp;

Alicia Keys feat. Nicki Minaj
Girl on Fire (Inferno Version)
The hardest-self-empowering woman in show business takes it all back to where she began, with a soulful pep talk about being your own best friend. "Girl on Fire," the first single and title track from Mrs. Swizz Beatz&#039;s upcoming album, comes in three different versions, the best of which is a straight up Eighties-style power ballad in Phil Collins mode: There are huge drums, crashing piano chords, a sky-scraping "oh-oh-oh" refrain, and the motto "This girl is on fire," plus a Nicki Minaj cameo in which she revisits her well-worn Marilyn Monroe obsession. Keys doesn&#039;t summon the lung power of a song like "No One," yet she sounds sisterly and bighearted: Give her credit for going Full Phil on this one.

Madonna feat. Nicki Minaj &amp; M.I.A.
“Give Me All Your Luvin’”
Madonnais a stressed-out party host on the first single from her forthcomingMDNA&ndash; so determined to show her guests thefunnest time everthat she winds up snapping champagne flutes in her white-knuckled grip and driving everyone out the door before the clock&#039;s struck 10:00. "Give Me All Your Luvin&#039;," written and produced by Madge and her latest Euro-dance collaborator, French DJ Martin Solveig, wants badly to be an irreverent bubblegum romp. It has a perky electro beat, a dippy singsong melody, and a cheerleader chant ("L-U-V, Madonna/Y-O-U, you wanna?") designed to evoke silly-fun pop classics like "Mickey" and "Hollaback Girl." But the tune and the lyrics seem dashed off, and the aggressive, assaultive spunkiness makes you want to run and hide. Not even the presence of two of the world&#039;s most reliably irrepressible pop stars, Nicki Minaj andM.I.A., can lift this party out of the doldrums. N-O, thanks: don&#039;t wanna.

Pitbull
Give Me Everything
Miami rapper Pitbull gets a long way on intensity, chomping down on songs like chew toys. On "Give Me Everything," aBlack Eyed Peas-like club-pop cut with a plaintive Ne-Yo chorus, he spits silly rhymes ("If you slip, I&#039;m gonna fall on top of your girl") with five times more conviction than they deserve.

Wild Flag
Glass Tambourine
You might expect the first studio leak from this group of well-established indie rockers to be one part aggro-daydream (Helium frontwoman Mary Timony) to two parts rocket thrust (Sleater-Kinney&#039;s Carrie Brownstein and Janet Weiss) with a taste of garage-pop sugar (the Minders&#039; keyboardist Rebecca Cole). Actually, "Glass Tambourine" &mdash; half of a seven-inch vinyl single due out on Record Store Day, April 16th &mdash; sounds like some wicked 1960s acid-rock yard-sale discovery, with Timony urging, "Listen to the music . . . before it passes you by." Then, Wild Flag launch into a ferocious closing guitar jam that&#039;s two parts Stooges, one part early Pink Floyd. Psych!

U2
Glastonbury
U2 have made their current European tour a testing ground for new material. The best of the new live songs is &quot;Mercy,&quot; cut during the sessions for 2004&#039;sHow to Dismantle an Atomic Bombbut not on the album. The band has reworked &quot;Mercy&quot; for the stage, turning it into a big bear hug of a ballad that almost sounds like it could have gone onJoshua Tree.&quot;You&#039;re going to kill me, and I want to die,&quot; Bono sings against the Edge&#039;s spacey arpeggios. &quot;We were meant for each other.&quot; Other tracks that thrilled fans this summer include the intensely rocking &quot;Return of the Stingray Guitar,&quot; the psychedelic &quot;Glastonbury&quot; and the starkly beautiful &quot;Every Breaking Wave.&quot; The latter recalls &quot;All I Want Is You,&quot; with Bono delivering dark poetry like &quot;The waves know we&#039;re on the rocks/Drowning is no sin.&quot; U2 say they have four separate albums in the works; if so, this is a good start.

Jay-Z feat. B.I.C.
Glory
Just 48 hours after the birth of his andBeyonc&eacute;&#039;sroyal heiress, Blue Ivy Carter,Jay-Zserved up this postpartum anthem with a lilting Neptunes beat, a news-breaking disclosure about a previous miscarriage ("All the pain of the last time/I prayed so hard it was the last time") and a sample of baby Blue herself. "Glory" is a hip-hop "Isn&rsquo;t She Lovely," mixing exultant proud-papa sentiments with brand-consolidation braggadocio: "A pinch of Hov, a whole glass of B." But the mood is reflective. "Everybody go through stuff," Jay tells his daughter. "Life is a gift, love, open it up."

Santigold feat. Karen O
Go
Hipster siren Santigold has said her new single is about "the new American Dream." If said dream includesYeah Yeah Yeahs&#039; Karen O getting her Interplanetary Warrior Priestess on over an electro-punk track you can jump-rope to, then America must be doing just fine.

The Killers
Go All the Way
This cover of the Raspberries&#039; warmly catchy power&ndash;pop classic (which appears on theDark Shadowssoundtrack) is fairly straightforward. But Brandon Flowers&#039; querulous voice lends the track an otherworldly urgency that&#039;s well matched to the film&#039;s sweetly macabre tone.

Kreayshawn
Go Hard
&nbsp;The rapper behind the viral earworm "Gucci Gucci" proves a bratty, insult-slinging MC can turn into a trash-pop princess, given a jittery enough dance beat and a little de-snarking. There&#039;s a familiar storyline &ndash; lifting stepdad&#039;s plastic, doing doughnuts in the parking lot &ndash; but the raft of earnest la-la-las speaks to her liberation.

The Hives
“Go Right Ahead”
The Swedish garage-rock pyrotechnicians crib from an unlikely source on this comeback single: ELO&#039;s "Don&#039;t Bring Me Down," whose main riff becomes this tune&#039;s backbone. The Hives dispense with the original&#039;s orchestral pomp in favor of horns and glam-rock stomp, but even Pelle Almqvist&#039;s howl can&#039;t help the track escape its source material&#039;s shadow.

Eddie Vedder and Natalie Maines
Golden State
This live acoustic cover of a song by former X frontman John Doe was released in honor of the West Memphis Three. Maines and Vedder&rsquo;s two very different voices merge for a shabbily heraldic ode to hard-won redemption.

A$AP Rocky
Goldie
Twenty-three-year-old Harlem rapper A$AP Rocky is a baby-faced young adult who could pass for a teenager. But he&#039;s got the soul of a classicist. "Goldie," the first single from the rising star&#039;s forthcoming major-label debut (due in July), is his latest exercise in hip-hop basics: It&#039;s full of relentless boasts and insults, delivered with low-key wit and admirably little fuss. The beat, by red-hot producer Hit-Boy ("Ni**as in Paris"), is full of keyboard blips and spacey vocal chorales, and A$AP Rocky&#039;s rhymes fall in the sweet spot between sublime and ridiculous: "You could call me Billy Gates, got a crib in every state," he raps. "Man on the moon, got a condo out in space."

Erykah Badu
Gone Baby, Don&#039;t Be Long
Director Flying Lotus creates an alien landscape where Badu fits in just fine. Watching the soul queen&#039;s visage glide around a trippy animated spaceship is nearly as hypnotic as listening to the breezily funked-out music.

Owl City and Carly Rae Jepsen
Good Time
Twerpy electropop savant Owl City tries his hand at straight-ahead dance beats, teaming with the"Call Me Maybe"singer for high-glucose cuteness. Jepsen shows a knack for playing the befuddled teen-dramedy heroine, while Owl City&#039;s Adam Young shows he was better at Disneyfyingthe Postal Servicethan he is at driving David Guetta to Gap Kids.

The Shins
Goodbye Girl
The latest in a sweet freebie MP3 series via Levi&#039;s jeans (hail the new music industry!) gets James Mercer back with his pre-Broken Bells group for a perfect Squeeze cover, guitar jangle replacing new-wave keybs while the titular girl moves off to Seattle rather than Jersey. Mercer wishes he wrote it; here, it sounds like he did.

T.I. feat. Keri Hilson
Got Your Back
If T.I. left prison and went straight to the &#039;musement park, got on a rollercoaster with Keri Hilson, and afterwards they ran into DJ Toomp at the caramel apple stand, and all went into the karaoke tent to commandeer the machine and record the spontaneous feeling of that moment, it&#039;d sound like "Got Your Back." T.I. tells "shoady" how to act while her man&#039;s locked up, while Keri equates looking "good" with looking "hood" as she pledges her allegiance. Toomp&#039;s digitally-lit pop track has hip-hop cranks and, best of all, a loony fairground organ loop. Late in the song, clearly a couple caramel apples into the first night of the rest of his life, T.I., fiddling with the plug-ins, decides, yes, to sing a bit in Auto-Tune. T.I.-Pain? Whatever you call him, just make sure you stay waiting by the phone next time he gets locked up.

Alanis Morissette
Guardian
Morissette&#039;swarble still has the power to peel shingles off rooftops. "Guardian" is an oath of fidelity, presumably to a lover, but when she begins yowling the chorus &ndash; "I&#039;ll be your keeper for life as your guardian" &ndash; it sounds like a threat.&nbsp;

Dirty Projectors
Gun Has No Trigger
This Brooklyn sextet &ndash; who dominated the grad student/barista scene with 2009&#039;sBitte Orca&ndash; are off their springy game on this new single. Over a flat, Soul Coughing-style hip-hop beat and bored-angel backing vocals, David Longstreth tunelessly yap-croons like David Byrne on a medieval torture rack. The lyrics evoke ambitions that come up empty &ndash; and the music does just that.

Kanye West and Jay-Z
H.A.M.
Click to listen to Kanye West and Jay-Z&#039;s "H.A.M."

Robyn
Hang With Me
Robyn&#039;s planning to release three albums this year and the first single from the set&#039;s second LP proves she&#039;s can crank out catchy jams as fast as pop&#039;s biggest hitmakers. "Hang With Me" is revamped version of an acoustic track fromBody Talk Pt. 1, made even better with the addition of a fierce, club-wrecking beat. "Just don&#039;t fall recklessly, heedlessly in love with me," Robyn coos. Too late.

Taio Cruz
Hangover
"I can drink until I throw up/And I don&#039;t ever, ever want to grow up," sings Taio Cruz &ndash; and can you blame him? Songs about partying yourself senseless are surefire these days, especially when bolstered by thudding production from Dr. Luke. Grimly effective, industrial strength party-pop.

Norah Jones
Happy Pills
"Would you please just let me go now?" pleads Norah Jones. She&rsquo;s addressing some fool who crushed her feelings, but you&#039;d hardly know it from the breezy way her voices wings over producer Danger Mouse&rsquo;s bopping bass line. Breaking up never sounded so fun.

Yelawolf feat. Lil Jon
Hard White (Up in the Club)
The New Wave-haired Alabama rapper brings geeked-up fire to his first single onEminem&#039;slabel. Lil Jon "yeah"&#039;s it up as Yela stalks the club, proudly spouting "hick" pride and making out like a thin white duke anyway.

Drake
Headlines
The voices in and outside of Drake&#039;s head tussle on his first officialTake Caresingle. "I had someone tell me I fell off; ooh, I needed that," he reflects, snares clacking away at some of his deftest rhymes since the spotlight-thrustingSo Far Gonemixtape. The spare beat never takes off, and the hook is a slight thing, almost an afterthought &ndash; or maybe the clearest sign that even with booze, cynics and fame buzzing about, hip-hop&#039;s great hope isn&rsquo;t overeager to please.

Blink-182
Heart&#039;s All Gone
The second taste of Blink&#039;s comeback LP reboots their bubblegum punk, setting a post-breakup bitchfest to shrink-wrapped hardcore that&#039;s pitched perfectly between the mosh pit and the food court.

Menomena
Heavy is as Heavy Does 
At the beginning of Menomena&#039;s new single, Justin Harris sings of his father&#039;s scorn as if he&#039;s camped out on a therapist&#039;s couch. But as Harris scales his "fucked-up family tree," his sorrowful ruminations melt into anger, and the song builds to a tempestuous guitar solo. The result is an emotive outburst of a song that expertly sidesteps melodrama &ndash; confessional rock thrills without the cheesy aftertaste.Listen to "Heavy is as Heavy Does":

Fleet Foxes
Helplessness Blues
The first fruit (and title track) fromHelplessness Blues, the Seattle folk-rockers&#039; upcoming second album, this begins with frontman Robin Pecknold sounding like a troubled Joni Mitchell and ends with him sounding like a utopian Graham Nash. Pecknold wrestles with life&#039;s meaning over vigorous acoustic strumming before excusing himself: "I&#039;ll get back to you someday soon," he keens, "you will see." Near the three-minute mark, those trademark harmonies explode amid electric guitar scribbles and daydreams: of working an orchard, acting in films. An amputated couplet appropriately ends it: dreams are like that.

Yeasayer
Henrietta
This Brooklyn band calls its upcoming third LP "demented R&amp;B,"and the alluringly weird first single makes good on that promise. Over hot molasses dub bass and flowery keyboard spritz, Chris Keating croons a ballad to Henrietta Lacks, a 1950s cancer patient whose cells were used for the polio vaccine after her death. But he delivers it with feeling &ndash; like they&#039;ve got a hot date tonight on the astral plane. And the mix of creepy&ndash;as&ndash;hell crush and first&ndash;rate historical research makes for nerd&ndash;soul magic.&nbsp;

Spiritualized
Hey Jane
Jason Pierce has always worn his classic-rock ambition on his poufy sleeve. So naturally his band&#039;s latest sounds like "Jane Says" and "Sweet Jane" with psychedelic Stones thrown in &ndash; a rowdy sing along that swells over its nine-minute course.

Wavves
Hippies Is Punks
Wavves&#039; Nathan Williams sounds under the influence of his girlfriend, Bethany "Best Coast" Cosentino, on this indie trinket. Cleaner and peppier than Wavves&#039; usual scuzz pop, it&#039;s likeDinosaur Jr.after aPhil Spectorbinge, and proof that in 2012 the title is truer than ever.

Britney Spears
Hold it Against Me
Click to listen to Britney Spears&#039; "Hold It Against Me"

Michael Jackson
Hold My Hand
When it first appeared, there was some doubt that this 2007 "collaboration" &mdash; circulated in a rough but near-identical version after Michael Jackson&#039;s death &mdash; really happened. (Members of Jackson&#039;s family are among the skeptics.) Musically, the controversy is much ado about little. "Hold My Hand," the lead single from the forthcoming posthumousMichaelLP, is a modestly anthemic &shy;ballad about sticking by loved ones in hard times, with a melody faintly echoing Bob Marley&#039;s "No Woman, No Cry." It certainly sounds like Jackson&#039;s voice, &shy;although the Auto-Tune-y veneer makes it hard to be certain. Akon, meanwhile, brings a pleasant Senegalese-reggae bounce to his duet parts. A decent song? Sure. An important addition to MJ&#039;s legacy? Hardly.

Rusko feat. Amber Coffman
Hold On
Christopher Mercer is a Leeds producer convinced dubstep can be ecstatic as well as stoned-somber. "Woo Boost" was one hot example. This joint with Dirty Projectors main diva Amber Coffman — a pro-forma r&amp;b come-on set to an awesome, gut-rumbling bass pulse — is another. And here&#039;s betting his work on M.I.A.&#039;s new set will keep the beat engorged.

My Morning Jacket
Holdin On to Black Metal
"Oh Black Metal you&#039;re so misunderstood," Jim James sings on this ode to Lucifer&#039;s favorite racket. Putting any actual metal in a song about metal would be way too obvious forthese genre-bending Southern boys. So on "Black Metal" &mdash; the latest offering fromCircuital, due May 31 &mdash; they roll out rubbery psychedelic soul complete with steel-wool guitar fuzz, pink-chiffon backup singers and a whacked-out wah-wah horn section &mdash; kicking ass with a velvet boot. They recorded the track in a church gym, so they may have some &#039;splaining to do when they meet their Maker. But at least they&#039;re riding to the Lake of Fire in style.

Glasser
Home
Art-rock gorgeousness from a newcomer to watch: Witchy woman Cameron Mesirow lays wind-swept vocals over a plinking marimba riff, then ups the drama with a flood of synths and an epically pining refrain.

The Rolling Stones
Honky Tonk Women
"Honky Tonk Women" would have made a great twenty minute cut onthe Stones&#039; new album; as it is this disc is most likely the strongest three minutes of rock and roll yet released in 1969. It deserves twenty minutes because the Stones give us just the most tantalizing taste of everything they do well, of everything they do the best. In spite ofMick&#039;s screaming, joyful singing, this time the star of the show isKeith Richards. He combines the cleanest, toughest guitar lines in rock with Charlie Watts&#039; jingling cowbell and steady drum shots for an introduction very similar to and equally as dramatic as that of Marvin Gaye&#039;s "I Heard It Through the Grapevine." Keith moves off after that, really fronting Mick himself, stretching sex with a smile out of every note, running up to the choruses with the same kind of perfect excitement Mike Bloomfield displayed on "Like a Rolling Stone." On the last two choruses Richard sings beautifully behind Mick, bending the words in counterpoint to Mick&#039;s straight shouts: "It&#039;s a haaaaawwww-aw-aw-aw-aw-kytonky woman! Bam! Gimme, Gimme, Gimme, Gimme . . . " It would have been a special gas to hear Keith sing a chorus all by himself.

Craig Finn
Honolulu Blues
Earlier this year, while theHold Steadywere on vacation, their workaholic frontman, Craig Finn, decamped to Austin to record a low-key solo LP steeped in the literate roots rock of his native Midwest. This seven-inch single is our first glimpse: "Honolulu Blues" is an artfully shambling Seventies boogie with plenty of dust on its mudflaps and loads of Catholic guilt tearing at its transmission, while "Rented Room" is a post-breakup blues on which Finn rolls out elegantly frayed guitar majesty that suggests he&#039;s more than just a brilliant lyricist.

Y.N.RichKids 
“Hot Cheetos &amp; Takis”  
A Minneapolis crew of actual children, part of an after-school program called Beats And Rhymes, come up with what may be the summer&#039;s final truly great jam. Over dramatic synth strings and 808ish thump, the kids deliver a jaw-dropper that may do for the title munchies what E.T. did for Reese&#039;s Pieces. Inspirational verse: "Snacks on snacks on snacks."

N.E.R.D. feat. Nelly Furtado
Hot N&#039; Fun
The slinky dance cut rocks a fat, minimalist Eighties funk groove &agrave; la Liquid Liquid&#039;s "Cavern," with Ms. Nelly on the ephemeral hook. "We wrote this for a purpose," begins Pharrell. "Get high, get money, get sex, get real!" Duly noted.

Prince
Hot Summer
A one-off jam Prince put out in celebration of his 52nd birthday, this vaguely beach-rock tune rides chirpy organ riffs and a bright melody that feels kind of kitschy. It would be great in an ad for a local water park, though.

Feist
How Come You Never Go There
It ain&#039;t exactly a party-starter. The first single from Metals,Leslie  Feist&#039;shotly anticipated third album, is a total downer, a bruising  ballad about a fracturing romance. ("How come you never go there?/How  come I&#039;m so alone there?" Feist sings.) But the music is riveting: a  tense soul-blues vamp, spiced with horns and raggedy electric guitar,  with Feist&#039;s clear, piercing voice&mdash;at once sad, remorseful and  accusatory&mdash;demanding your attention all the while.

Alabama Shakes 
How Many More Times
Brittany Howard &ndash; the wrecking ball who fronts this roots band &ndash; turnsZeppelin&#039;sblues miasma into a scorched-earth riposte. When she moans, "I got another child on the way, that makes 11/I&#039;m in constant heaven," sexual abandon takes on a whole new burden.

Lil Wayne
How to Love
How to love?Lil Waynehas a theory. You grab an acoustic guitar. You toss in some strings. You rap a little, sing a little, whisper sweet nothings: "I admire your poppin&#039; bottles and dippin&#039;/Just as much as you admire bartendin&#039; and strippin&#039;." ThisTha Carter IVsingle is a casual ground-breaker &ndash; the gentlest, most melodic rap ballad since LL Cool J&#039;s "I Need Love." Wayne sings prettily &ndash; though he uses Auto-Tune, he doesn&#039;t sound like the cyborg Weezy of "Lollipop." He even channels James Blunt. "You&#039;re beautiful/You&#039;re beautiful," he coos. "You&#039;re far from the usual."

Coldplay
Hurts Like Heaven
These new songs &ndash; all debuted live in recent months but not yet released in studio versions &ndash; suggestColdplay&#039;sforthcoming album may be more gritty, fun, strange and (yes) danceable than any so far: aZooropato theUnforgettable Fireof 2008&#039;sViva la Vida. "Hurts Like Heaven" opened their Lollapalooza set with a word rush that occasionally recalledLCD Soundsystem&#039;s"All My Friends," plus some outstanding guitar asides. Broadcast on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, "Charlie Brown" (not the Coasters&#039; 1959 hit, alas) triangulatesSpringsteen,U2andArcade Firein a hood-rat oratorio that roars even if Chris Martin&#039;s delivery feels too genteel. "Us Against the World" (debuted at the Rock am Ring festival in Germany) is an anthemic ballad with sweet harmony vocals from drummer/secret weapon Will Champion. Most interesting may be "Princess of China," with a dubby drum track so huge, it apparently blew out all the bootleggers&#039; mics in Nuremberg.

Of Montreal
Hydra Fancies
Kevin Barnes has been slowly morphing Of Montreal into a straight-up white-soul band for a few years now, and with &#039;Hydra Fancies&#039; — from the psychedelic Georgia band&#039;s upcomingFalse Priest— he&#039;s finally realized his vision. This funky, tight-harmony jam could be a lostDirty Mind-era Prince cut — at least until Barnes tells his beloved, &#039;Touching you is like standing on a dragon&#039;s tongue.&#039; Hot bonus: a vintage-synth freak-out at the end.

Chromeo feat. Ezra Koenig
I Could Be Wrong
On this magnificently cheesy synth-pop jam, indie rock&#039;s reigning Columbia grad (Vampire Weekend&#039;s Koenig) duets with electro-funk&#039;s reigning Columbia Ph.D. candidate (Chromeo&#039;s Dave 1), singing in falsetto about a mind-game-playing hottie. The real scene-stealer, though, is the scorching sax solo at the end.

Young Jeezy feat. Jay-Z &amp; Andre 3000
I Do
On this exuberant rap ode to beer goggles &ndash; or, in this case, Belvedere goggles - three of the world&#039;s biggest MCs load up on vodka and propose marriage to honeys in the V.I.P. room. &nbsp;Jay-Zcoos sweet nothings ("I walk down this aisle faithfully, cut that cake for me") over a pumping, brass-bolstered beat, while Andre 3000 waxes poetic ("Lets put a baby butterfly up in your lil&#039; cocoon"). As for Jeezy, he dispenses with the flowery stuff and gets to the point: "I&#039;ll do anything to leave here tonight with you,"he barks. "I said I do, I do, I do, I do, I do."

Beck
I Just Started Hating Some People Today
IsJack Whitehiding a time machine at Third Man Records HQ? That&#039;s the only logical explanation for this White-produced one-off, in whichBeckis transformed into a zooted prankster. The A side is a smirking Nashville pastiche ("I just started wanting to punch your face/You might want to wear a helmet just in case"); "Blue Randy" finds Beck sighing sad tales of laser tag over burnt-caramel steel guitar. If the jokes made more sense, they wouldn&#039;t be half as funny.

School of Seven Bells
I L U
The "L" stands forlovedand this dollop of dream-pop from New York trio School of Seven Bells perfectly captures all the sadness and heartache that past-tense verb implies. Over a rippling layer of keyboards and a gentle, surging backbeat, singers Alejandra and Claudia Deheza apply their angelic voices to lyrics about lost love and blown opportunities. It&#039;s a rich, moody weeper — the ethereality of the Cocteau Twins fused with the steady, electronic pulse of M83.

Enrique Iglesias Feat. Pitbull
I Like It
Enrique is back with his most danceable fiesta since "Bailamos" swept the States more than a decade ago. Rather than getting his samba on, he&#039;s scouting for some forbidden nookie with a babe he can&#039;t keep his hands off of &shy; while his girl&#039;s out of town. "No one can know the things I&#039;m gonna wanna do to you," he swoons. And Pitbull gives us insight into his bedroom: "Tiger Woods times Jesse James equals Pitbull all night long." Cheating never sounded so fun!

Icona Pop
I Love It
On this female Swedish duo&#039;s supercatchy breakup anthem, skyscraping synth lines go up as they scream-sing about the liberation that comes from dumping a draggy partner.

Rick Ross
I Love My Bitches
Bitches aren&#039;t the only things that Rick Ross loves. For one thing, there&#039;s alliteration: "Bottles, Beamers, brandnew Benzes/Barbies, ballerinas andBritneys/Barbra Streisand-edition Bentleys." (One might add booming beats and boasts as big as that beard.) The first of two singles from the Miami MC&#039;s fifth solo album &ndash;God Forgives, I Don&#039;t, due out December 13th &ndash; is topnotch Ross, with the rapper delivering a torrent of witty brags (about everything from his sexploits to his taste for lobster bisque) over a chipmunk soul beat from Just Blaze. By comparison, Ross&#039; second new track, "You the Boss," is a dud: a pro forma foray into bedroom rap, with some extremely annoying Auto-Tuned warbling from Ms. Minaj. Ross being Ross, romance gets conflated with finance &ndash; his real true love: "All I fiend is a queen in my presence/I can hold her until I die/ Couple G&#039;s in my bezel."

Elvis and Lisa Marie Presley
I Love You Because
The soundtrack to a video commemorating the 35th anniversary ofElvis&#039; death, this is essentially a reissue of the sweetly sentimental country ballad from his self-titled 1956 debut &ndash; until just past the halfway point, when his daughter&#039;s harmonies float in. Lisa Marie starts out tentative, almost sheepish. But the emotional communion of it settles in, and just like Natalie and Nat King Cole&#039;s "Unforgettable," it becomes a legit tear-jerker.

Wilco
I Might
For their first release since leaving the major label game and hanging their own shingle (what took so long?),Wilcodeliver a seven-inch single that sounds like it was knocked out by a garage band, albeit a knowing one. "It&#039;s alright/You won&#039;t set the kids on fire/Oh I might," sings Jeff Tweedy, like he&#039;s having a late night talk to the mirror after some teenagers yelled "Dad rocker!" at him outside the mini-mart. Mikael Jorgensen adds some nasty-sounding Farfisa organ, guitarist Nels Cline spits riffs like he&#039;s having a seizure. Then everyone gets pretty on the chorus, because, well, they can. The B-side is a cheeky cover of Nick Lowe&#039;s "I Love My Label," in case you missed the subtext. Freedom is good.

Public Enemy
I Shall Not Be Moved
Leave it to Chuck D to own his age: "I work it/UH!/the senior circuit." Crafted by Chuck and Gary G-Wiz, this single (fromPublic Enemy&#039;s upcoming album,Most of My Heroes Still Don&#039;t Appear On No Stamp) is one of PE&#039;s toughest, leanest, weirdest tracks in years, live drums and pure-funk guitar leaning into fuzzy synth wobble worthy of Skrillex or Throbbing Gristle. Chuck can still hector with the best, dissing Clive Davis and bellowing "What good is learnin&#039; from some record/ when y&#039;all only listen to 15 seconds?" The Hard Rhymer would like you to get off his lawn and also to pay attention. It is welcome.

Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers
I Should Have Known It
Petty wasn&#039;t kidding about bringing a bluesier sound toMojo, his new album (and 12th with the Heartbreakers). The CD&#039;s first single kicks off with a caustic riff that ZZ Top would love to have written, and Petty adopts a nasty sneer as he kicks aside a two-timing lover. The slow-boiling rage makes this one of his best bad-love songs, and when he declares, "It&#039;s the last time you&#039;re gonna hurt me," you know the man is hellbent serious.

Mumford &amp; Sons
I Will Wait
Mumford &amp; Sons&#039; debut was a surprising breakout record: A bunch ofPogues-loving Brits dressed like they just galloped in from the set ofLittle House on the Prairiesuddenly became the nextColdplay. But maybe we shouldn&#039;t have been surprised; where most folk music goes for intimacy, M&amp;S go for arena grandeur. They&#039;ve jokingly described their forthcoming LP,Babel, as "Black Sabbathmeets Nick Drake," and this single shades in that direction with its hammer-down forlornness and road-weary lyrics about living through "days of dust." But then the Mummies serve up some bread and butter on the chorus, a Bono-big pledge of fidelity perfect for misty-eyed singalongs.

Radiohead
“Identikit (Live)”
Radioheadhave been peppering the set lists on their latest arena tour with some new works in progress &ndash; prime hunks of red meat for fans left ravenous by last year&#039;s all-too-briefThe King of Limbs. One highlight, "Identikit," is a sly siren song: "When I see you messing me around, I don&#039;t want to know," Thom Yorke warns, nimbly weaving his falsetto around twin drummers Phil Selway and Clive Deamer&#039;s hiccupping patterns. "Skirting on the Surface," known to hardcore fans from Yorke&#039;s 2009 Atoms for Peace tour, is even better &ndash; a spooky semi-acoustic ballad with a juicy low end, like a paranoid android that knows how to move on the dance floor. Both tunes feel warmer and easier to love than much ofKing of Limbs. Can&#039;t wait to see how they mutate and bloom when Radiohead get back to a studio.

Elton John
If It Wasn&#039;t for Bad
Russell is an Oklahoma-bred singer who wowed John 40 years ago and later fell off the map. The lead track from their duets album is a wise-cracking lament, with John echoing Russell&#039;s distinct nasal twang. The song transitions to an Electric Light Orchestra-style fantasia, before the keyboards take it all back to the chorus. The end result is both masterful and gratifyingly odd.

Passion Pit
I&#039;ll Be Alright
The latest release from this Massachusetts electro-pop band is a mordant breakup song &ndash; not that you can tell. The music is roaring, hyperactive and triumphant, with Michael Angelakos crooning amid glitchy beats, cresting synths and hints of Afropop.

M.I.A.
I&#039;m A Singer
Because tweeting the cell number of Lynn Hirschberg, the reporter responsible for an unflatteringNew York Times Magazineprofile on her, wasn&#039;t enough revenge, M.I.A. released this dis track. Over murky electro, she calls out writers and Hirschberg in particular: "Journalists be thick as shit. . . . You&#039;re a racist, I wouldn&#039;t trust you one bit." "Singer" is bland as music, and though M.I.A. has a right to be miffed, it&#039;s less interesting than the raw audio about those truffle-flavored french fries.

Randy Newman
I&#039;m Dreaming
Returning to the unreliable all-American narrators of "Political Science" and "Short People," Newman plays a voter longing for the good old days. "I&#039;m dreaming of a white president," he croons, "just like the ones we&#039;ve always had." A tear is shed for William McKinley; President Taft is imagined ass-out in Africa. Then, the punch line: "He won&#039;t be the brightest, perhaps/But he&#039;ll be the whitest/And I&#039;ll vote for that." It&#039;s satire that will be misconstrued, denounced and used by no one as a campaign theme. Brilliant.

DJ Shadow feat. Afrikan Boy
I&#039;m Excited
Shadow&#039;s music used to be touched by the uncanny; this may be the  clunkiest thing he&#039;s done. Stray, seemingly found noises give the groove  ridges, but it&#039;s so busy it never finds its footing.

T.I.
I&#039;m Flexin&#039;
"Prison ain&#039;t changed shit, homeboy," crowsT.I.on the first new track since his release. Luckily, his skills and charisma are also intact. "I&#039;m Flexin&#039;" is an unadulterated exercise in pure flow, with T.I. scattering boasts and liquid Dirty South vowels over Big K.R.I.T.&#039;s alternately tinkling and snarling beat.

Jennifer Lopez feat. Lil Wayne
I&#039;m Into You
Amuy romanticochorus; a guest rap byLil Wayne; a lithesome beat pitched somewhere between Puerto Rican reggaeton and Jamaican dancehall, cooked up by can&#039;t-miss hitmakers Stargate. "I&#039;m Into You" should be a hot summer single. But the lyrics are painfully insipid ("You got me hooked with your love controller"), and the bland singsong tune fails to work its way into your mind&#039;s ear. Even Weezy, sounding as irrepressible as ever, can&#039;t coax any pep out of the desultory J. Lo.

Donald Fagen
I&#039;m Not the Same Without You
This track from the Steely Dan singer&#039;s upcoming LP is about a dude surviving a breakup via determined self-delusion, but it&#039;s no bummer. It&#039;s a wry and witty portrait that makes fine use of a Steely-style chillaxin&#039; soul-jazz groove and Fagen&#039;s poker-face croon.

DJ Khaled feat. Drake, Rick Ross and Lil Wayne
I&#039;m On One
The credits make this sound like a posse cut, but it&#039;s unmistakably Drake&#039;s  party. Over fidgety synths as cold as Toronto in January, he croons about fame&#039;s  rewards and kvetches about its annoyances ("All that hype don&#039;t feel the same  next year, boy") - a serviceable stopgap till his next LP. The others keep it  brief: Ross makes gangsta clich&eacute;s sound improbably cool,Weezyfires off  half-asleep punch lines and Khaled bellows his name once before vanishing.

Das Racist
I&#039;m Up on That
These baked Brooklyn MCs got sophisticated since they stumbled into that Pizza Hut-Taco Bell: Moving into jazz rap,  they spit witty rhymes &mdash; "Every Thanksgivin&#039;/I&#039;m killin&#039;/A pilgrim" &mdash; while name-checking the D.C. sniper and Harry Nilsson.

Antony and the Johnsons
Imagine
"Imagine there&#039;s no heaven/It was easy when I tried," sings Antony in his startling warble, reshaping John Lennon&#039;s melody amid spare guitars. Then he sends that falsetto "you" into the sky like a white dove. An unlikely, gorgeous reinvention.

Tim Maia
Imunização Racional (Que Beleza)
This 1976 soul grenade previews a forthcoming anthology that&#039;s taken years of crate-digging and cross-licensing. A Brazilian morph ofCurtis MayfieldandBarry White, Maia sings of enlightenment via Cultura Racional, the space-obsessed, Scientology-style religious cult, which sounds pretty darn groovy.

Dev
In The Dark
This California electrohop diva is known for her slithering monotone on Far East Movement&#039;s "Like a G6." Here, Dev speak-sings about her sex drive over a Nineties Latin house beat like a top-shelf version of Ke$ha &ndash; seductive, not sleazy.

Robyn
Indestructible
The Swedish diva drops the first single fromBody Talk PT 3,a disco remake of a ballad fromPT 2.She sings an uncommonly elegant Europop melody, promising, &quot;I&#039;m gonna love you like I&#039;ve never been hurt before.&quot;

Jane&#039;s Addiction
Irresistible Force
This single &mdash; fromThe Great Escape Artist,Jane&#039;s Addiction&#039;sfirst  album in eight years, due September 27th &mdash; comes on like an art-metal  freak show set on some distant planet. It opens with Perry Farrell  sounding like Carl Sagan in an episode of Cosmos, musing ominously about the stars and some sort of big bang. The verses are built around droning funk, as the band backs Farrell&#039;s ponderings with a rubbery bass line and some clattering percussion. But then Farrell unleashes that familiar majestic bray of his, asks whether we wonder what the band looks like naked (uh, that horse has left the barn, dude) and announces, "God is a real man." Or is it "God isn&#039;t real, man?" Whatever: Giant guitar swarms from Dave Sitek and Dave Navarro soon blow away Farrell&#039;s philosophizing.

K&#039;naan feat. Nelly Furtado
Is Anybody Out There 
Are you homely, like "Mary," who "never won a pageant"? Or angry, like "Adam," who "grew up mad and anti-social"? K&rsquo;naan and Nelly Furtado are here to raise your self-esteem: "This is for everyone who felt invisible," the Canadian hip-pop aristocracy beckon. Early front-runner for 2012&rsquo;s most dispiriting pop pep talk.

Steven Tyler
(It) Feels So Good
Steven Tyler&#039;s first official solo single has his doofiest parenthesis-abusing title since "Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees)." He uses anAerosmith-style guitar riff and some chintzy synth drums, but he can&#039;t shape them into anything resembling an Aero&shy;smith song &ndash; it sounds more like late-periodGenesis, circa "I Can&#039;t Dance." Even when he honks a harmonica, it&#039;s impossible not to notice how offensively wussy the guitars are. "(It) Feels So Good" ends up sounding like a cry for help, in the form of Aero&shy;smith&#039;s Joe Perry and Brad Whitford.

Bruno Mars
It Will Rain
Who better than Bruno Mars to lead the promotional blitz forTwilight&#039;slatest soundtrack? Mars&#039; clean-cut looks and gently scuffed croon make him an ideal nonthreatening crush &ndash; and last year&#039;s smash "Grenade," on which he threatened to blow himself up for attention, proved his knack for overheated romantic dialogue. Mars gets similarly melodramatic on this ballad ("If you ever leave me, baby, leave some morphine at my door"), but the real point is the song&#039;s desperately yearning melody. It sounds a little bit like "Wild Horses," and a lot like Mars&#039; next radio juggernaut.

Paul McCartney
It&#039;s So Easy
Buddy Hollywas  one of the Beatles&#039; biggest influences, a pioneer whose simple tunes  and insane two-year hot streak inspired John Lennon andPaul McCartneyto start writing their own songs. So it&#039;s no shock McCartney contributed toRave On,  a giant sundae of a Holly tribute album (featuring the Black Keys, Kid  Rock and others) due out June 28th. What&#039;s surprising is how awesomely  batshit his performance is. Over bar-band chug-a-lug, with scruffy  guitars egging him on, he yowls through "It&#039;s So Easy" like he popped  some Viagra, then set his pants on fire. Things get truly odd around the  three-minute mark: The music stops while he launches into a bizarro  jive-rap about how he&#039;s gonna hit the town with his lady. The chorus  kicks back in, then McCartney delivers an even odder rap: "By &#039;bout half  past nine, we&#039;re gonna be down by the old juke joint, man, we&#039;re gonna  be playin&#039; them records, we&#039;re gonna be dancin&#039;, man, we&#039;re gonna havesuch fun." True, that.

The White Stripes
I&#039;ve Been Loving You Too Long
Jack and Meghave called it quits, but there&#039;s good news: Third Man  Records plans to gradually roll out a load of unreleased White Stripes  songs. The newest offerings &mdash; covers cut in 1997 &mdash; prove the Stripes  sounded like themselves from the get-go: On Love&#039;s druggy ballad  "Signed D.C.," Jack moans about addiction over a beat that&#039;s minimalist  even for Meg. Their take on Otis Redding&#039;s "I&#039;ve Been Loving You Too  Long" is livelier: Jack&#039;s vocals are sweet, but his fuzzed-out guitar  suggests deeper torment. More, please.

The Ghost of a Saber-Tooth Tiger
Jardin Du Luxembourg
"People say your brain is like cream cheese/Takes the shape of anything you please," sing Sean Lennon and Charlotte Kemp Muhl on the debut single from their new band. It&#039;s a fitting line for a chirpy psych-rocker — one with a whiff of Papa Lennon&#039;s surrealist whimsy.

Far East Movement
Jello
The hip-housers known for getting "slizzard" on "Like a G6" return with a brassy Rye Rye to demand booty-shaking over Tetris-worthy synths and bring high-low absurdism to hashtag rap: "Play with your G-string/Cello." Condolences to Yo-Yo Ma.

Vampire Weekend
Jonathan Low
Finally, the marketing strategy behind Vampire Weekend&#039;s name becomes clear: A remarkably anthemic song for the soundtrack toEclipse, this week&#039;s edition of the teen-baitingTwilightvampire saga. With 12-string acoustic guitar, swelling strings, and lyrics that seem to have something to do with "blood," indie rock&#039;s poppiest preppies sound startlingly like a junior varsity U2 — which is pretty damn impressive, actually.

Lady Gaga
Judas
From its drone-smeared synth throb to its bizarro hook,Gaga&#039;s latest club-crusher is a feistier monster than"Born This Way."A bad-romance confessional about a lover she can&#039;t leave behind, "Judas" is Gaga in full-on provocateur mode. (The video&#039;s Mary Magdalene motif already has Catholicsbunching their undies.) But even when Gaga plays divider, she&#039;s still a uniter; despite lines like "In the most biblical sense, I am beyond repentance/Fame hooker, prostitute, wench," she works her grandma-scandalizing magic without losing any of her anthemic whoosh.

How To Destroy Angels
Keep It Together
Trent Reznor can still worm his way into your heart and make your skin crawl at the same time. This track with his band How to Destroy Angels coasts on a torpid, mutant-slinky beat, but when he and wife Mariqueen Maandig repeat the title over and over, it&#039;s creepily sweet &ndash; like they&#039;re holding each other through a dark, sweaty night of the soul.

Sara Bareilles
King of Anything
Like her 2007 hit "Love Song," this single shows off Bareilles&#039; ability to tuck a heartfelt kiss-off into a perky piano-pop tune. Over an arrangement outfitted with hand claps and horns, Bareilles delivers smooth-voiced complaints about an overbearing acquaintance without losing her cool — the closing line, "Let me hold your crown, babe," is as mean as Bareilles gets. For introspective pop, sensitive adults and teenage girls could do a whole lot worse.

Wavves
King of the Beach
Wavves frontman Nathan Williams has only been making lo-fi bedroom punk for two years, but he&#039;s already generated a career&#039;s worth of hype and backlash, especially after his erratic meltdown on stage at the 2009 Primavera Sound Festival in Barcelona. Fortunately, the clanging title track proves he&#039;s pulled his act together: "King of the Beach" features a big, bratty melody, booming drums and a catchy, lo-fi guitar hook that scrapes like sandpaper. Williams has also retained a true punk-rock sense of defiance: "You&#039;re never gonna stop me!" he howls over and over in the chorus. Just try and prove him wrong.

Band of Horses
Knock Knock
Band of Horsesusually lie deep&nbsp;in the sweet spot between the dreamy Nineties guitar majesty ofBuilt to Spilland gorgeously harmonized, golden-bearded Seventies folk rock. But this has more going on under the hood than usual, implying the band&#039;s&nbsp;upcoming LP will be its most rocking yet. Ben Bridwell sings about "a ramshackle crew with something to prove" over guitars that are more Crazy Horse than America while the drums gallop out of the garage.

Dr. Dre
Kush
The most amusing thing about the first single from Dre&#039;s long-gestatingDetoxalbum? Hearing Snoop claim he needs weed for his "cataracts." Otherwise, "Kush" is hookless, forgettable bud love.

Michael Kiwanuka
Lasan
A Londoner of Ugandan descent, Kiwanuka makes no secret of his heroes: Bill Withers, Richie Havens and the Band. Buton this slow-rolling, Dan Auerbach-assisted cut, it&#039;s his rich, ragged voice that pulls you in. He sounds like his own man, not an imitator.

Panda Bear
Last Night at the Jetty
The Animal Collective crooner evokes the sound of a woozy man stringing together bits of doo-wop at the bottom of a well, backed by wobbly synth, hand claps and the odd shriek. We&#039;ll have what he&#039;s having!

Insane Clown Posse
Leck mich im Arsch 
This really happened:Jack Whiteand the least respected white guys ever doing a rap-metal cover of a Mozart canon whose title translates to "Lick Me in the Arse." To their credit, it&#039;s kind of a brilliant, subversive comment on the timelessness of bad taste in Western art. But at what cost, Jack? At what cost?

Aerosmith
Legendary Child
For the past two decades, Steven Tyler has pushedAerosmithtoward power ballads while Joe Perry has lobbied for hard rock. It seems Perry won the argument for this comeback single. "Legendary Child" &ndash; from the band&#039;s first studio album in eight years, due this fall &ndash; is built on stacks of guitars, though it sounds like the band was too busy blasting away to bother with much of a melody. Instead, you get a so&ndash;so tune and Tyler&ndash;esque wisdom, like "Sticks and stones will break your bones, or at least will rearrange them." It&#039;s great to have the fellas back and getting sweaty, but how about tossing in one of those killer sleaze‐rock hooks next time?

Trey Songz feat. Amerie
Let&#039;s Chill
This sparkly slow jam literally starts in the club: It&#039;s late and Amerie is ready to call it a night. But then she spots club-weary crooner Trey Songz, who offers the leggy songbird his immodest lullaby: "Rockabye baby when the beat drop/ don&#039;t let your friends know we about to creep off." When that beat drops and desire goes boom, Amerie and Trey soar, showing that like Donnie Hathaway and Roberta Flack before them, the pair have some serious harmony.

Laura Cantrell
Letters She Sent
The Nashville-to-New York transplant sings of three women coping with regret: Donna, Julie and Mary (who got home with "her stockings on crooked/But she didn&#039;t care"). Recorded on a back porch, it&#039;s country music as homemade bread.

Devendra Banhart feat. Beck
Life During Wartime
The unearthly theme song for Todd Solondz&#039;s latest film of the same name was crafted for its meek social worker protagonist to perform in the middle of the movie. But a better version plays as the credits roll: Banhart sings lead, his L.A. buddy Beck provides harmony, and their arrangement of layered acoustic guitars and shape-shifting electronics are a perfect contrast to Solondz&#039;s wry, cranky lyrics: "Why did I roam around on my own," the pair croak. "I should&#039;ve stayed at home and thrown out your iPhone."

Drake feat. Jay-Z and Lil Wayne
Light Up (Rikers Remix)
A song about how hard it is to keep the world partying when you feel like dying inside, &#039;Light Up&#039; was already one of the more poignant tracks on Drake&#039;sThank Me Later. Jay-Z&#039;s cameo was note-perfect (&#039;I&#039;m not as cool with niggas as I once was&#039;). But this remix cranks the pathos to 11 with a verse from Lil Wayne — delivered over the phone from freakin&#039; Rikers Island. (Is this how he used his one phone call? Talk about true to the game!) Reception in jail must really suck because the connection is so hazy it renders his commanding bullfrog croak into something thin and frayed. But Wayne is clearly elated to reach out and touch someone, and prison hasn&#039;t dulled his cleverness one bit: &#039;Come to my cell/Readin&#039; fan mail/Wish I was in Amsterdam sippin&#039; Amstel/Thinkin&#039; about all of that pussy I can&#039;t smell/Man, they did me wrong — I feel like Nelson Mandel&#039;."

Interpol
Lights
On 2007&#039;sOur Love to Admire, New York&#039;s doomy New Wavers abandoned taut goth punk in favor of bigger, more expansive art rock. Chastened, the band is back to its old voodoo on a new single. "Lights" is like six Joy Division slow songs played at once, beginning with a crawling riff that could have been recorded in Dracula&#039;s wine cellar, and building to groove euphoria. Paul Banks reanimates Ian Curtis as the world&#039;s worst boyfriend. "Maybe I like to stray," he moans. "It&#039;s like you want it that way."

Amy Winehouse feat. Nas
Like Smoke
The wise pop music fan learned long ago to be wary of Ambulance Chaser Music &ndash; records scrambled into the marketplace soon after the death of a beloved star. "Like Smoke," the first taste ofAmy Winehouse&#039;sforthcoming posthumous albumLioness: Hidden Treasures, is a classic Ambulance Chaser. It&#039;s a transparent patchwork job, stitching together a retro-soul vamp (with velvety production from Salaam Remi), some pleasant but undistinguished singing from Winehouse, and a slew of so-so rhymes fromNas(including a verse that, incongruously, tips a hat to Occupy Wall Street). It&#039;s not a song, exactly. Call it a songlet, if you like. Or maybe just call it a cash-grab. Winehouse&#039;sBack to Blackwas one of the most rigorously realized records in recent memory. It&#039;s a disservice to her memory to put out music this half-baked.

The Avett Brothers
Live and Die
It&#039;s an old pop music verity: You can be an old softie, if you have the tunes to back it up. On the lead single from the Rick Rubin-proucedThe Carpenter, due in September, not much has changed: the Avett Brothers are still indie&#039;s dippiest sentimentalists &ndash; "I want to love you and more/I want to find you and more/Where do you reside when you hide?" &ndash; and still among its sharpest melodists, with banjos plinking along to swooping power-pop melody worthy ofBig Star.

Dom feat. Gucci Mane
Living in America (Remix) 
On this unlikely collaboration, indie-pop band Dom slow their patriotic original while Atlanta MC Gucci Mane drawls hypnotically and turns "Brett Favre!" into a club chant. Only in America.

Bruno Mars
Locked Out of Heaven
Bruno Mars is one of pop&#039;s courtliest young stars &ndash; a gentleman through and through, from his chivalric oaths ("I&#039;d catch a grenade for ya") to the rakish Sinatra-style tilt of his fedora. But Mars&#039; new single doesn&#039;t bother with old-fashioned euphemism. "Your sex takes me to paradise," he cries. The song is about unbridled passion, but as usual with Mars, the aesthetic is tidy and impeccable, pop songcraft polished to a high-gloss gleam: jittery Police-esque rock-reggae verses that erupt, amid thunder-boom synths, into a steamrolling four-on-the-floor chorus. There are at least a half-dozen big hooks here, including the background grunts of "Oooh!" &ndash; for those who didn&#039;t realize that Bruno&#039;s serious about the sexy business.

The Black Keys
Lonely Boy
The first single from the Black Keys&#039;El Camino(due out December 6th) moves like the album&#039;s vintage Chevy namesake &ndash; a swift, sturdy hunk of all-American cool. On last year&#039;sBrothers, the duo tightened up their stadium-blues attack and took home a few Grammys. Now they&#039;re pushing that badass sound to even faster speeds. Drummer Patrick Carney pounds out a hammer-of-the-gods backbeat while singer-guitarist Dan Auerbach peels off lean riffs and wails about a twisted affair ("You pull my heart out, and I don&#039;t mind bleeding"), sounding like he&#039;s practically frothing at the mouth. Frustrated desire is the song&#039;s ostensible theme &ndash; "I got a love that keeps me waiting," Auerbach gripes &ndash; but for Keys fans, this is a clean hit of instant gratification.

Red Hot Chili Peppers
Long Progression
The chiming opening notes on this new B side suggest a Sonic Youth jam, until the band comes in all fist pump pop-rock funky and Anthony Kiedis crows, "Been around for quite a while." Yes, he has. But by the time he hits the bit about atrophy ("Vision takes a nap, but I will put up quite a fight on"), one can&#039;t help but cheer him on.

Kanye West
Lord Lord Lord
Kanye visits the chill-out lounge, delivering a seven-minute-plus opus that&#039;s languid in the extreme: Psychedelic-soul synths float on a groove that wouldn&#039;t sound out of place on your smooth-jazz station. The rapping is equally laid-back: Mos Def purrs abstractions (&quot;Ecstatic patterns in the calendar design&quot;); Swizz Beatz slurs boasts about cars and suede attire; Raekwon muses on weed-smoking. Kanye, meanwhile, is full of punch lines &mdash; &quot;If I&#039;m a douche, then put me in your coochie&quot; &mdash; which is about as close to chilled-out as pop&#039;s spaz-in-chief ever gets.

Kanye West feat. Bon Iver and Gil Scott-Heron
Lost in the World
The latest leak from Camp Kanye is less a song than an inspired chunk of Nineties-style DJ mixology. It begins with Bon Iver &mdash; the Wisconsin-bred folkie who collaborated on nine songs for West&#039;s upcoming album &mdash; singing a revamped version of &quot;Woods,&quot; his haunting, Auto-Tuned meditation from 2009. Vocal rounds swell into a gospel chorus, fat 4/4 drums kick on, and there&#039;s Kanye pledging, &quot;If we die in each other&#039;s arms/Still get laid in the afterlife.&quot; (Tr&eacute;s romantique!) Then, Kanye peels away the lushness, switching to a conga beat and sampling Gil Scott-Heron&#039;s 1970 &quot;Comment #1&quot; at length. Scott-Heron&#039;s radical poetics about a nation &quot;now blood and tears instead of milk and honey&quot; are a perfect contrast to the gorgeous heartbreak of Bon Iver, and overall, &quot;Lost in the World&quot; is the sound of a hip-hop icon on a wild creative bender: dizzying, sometimes baffling, perpetually spectacular.

Jack White
Love Interruption 
The soloJack Whitedoesn&#039;t seem entirely sure what to do with himself, and sometimes &ndash; as on this loopy little soul sketch &ndash; that&#039;s what makes him eternally interesting. "I want love to grab my fingers gently, slam them in a doorway, put my face into the ground," the recent divorc&eacute; sings, hammering on his acoustic as organ spritz and puppy-eyed Casio bassoon evoke "Son of a Preacher Man." Nashville singer (and onetimeSing-Offcontestant) Ruby Amanfu&rsquo;s harried backing warble fits a song that adds an awkwardly personal wrinkle to theWhite Stripes&#039; errant primitivism.

Jack White
Love Is Blindness
In honor of the 20th birthday reissue ofU2&#039;sbig electro-poppy left turn,Achtung Baby, the ex-White Stripereinvents the album&#039;s meditative closer into a scorched blues-rock howl. The tune is as akin to Screamin&#039; Jay Hawkins&#039; "I Put a Spell on You" as it is to the hushed, piano-flecked original. "I&#039;m too numb to feel,"Whitedeclares after a fierce guitar tantrum. Doesn&#039;t sound like it, dude. By the way, how&#039;s that solo joint coming along?

Steven Tyler
Love Lives
Tyler recorded his first solo single forSpace Battleship Yamato,a Japanese sci-fi film set in 2199. But the song is stuck in 1997: It&#039;s a ballad with an orchestral sound so big you can see spaceships explode while lovers em- brace. It&#039;s no &quot;Dream On,&quot; and it&#039;s not quite &quot;I Don&#039;t Want to Miss a Thing.&quot; Let&#039;s hope Tyler saved the rockers for Aerosmith&#039;s next LP.

The Afghan Whigs
“Lovecrimes”
The newly-revived Whigs, who used to do this sort of thing all the time in the 1990s withPrince,TLCand New Order songs, busted out this Frank Ocean heart-breaker on their latest tour before formalizing it here with a studio recording. Greg Dulli and perpetually underrated guitarist Rick McCollum know exactly how to execute it, turning Ocean&rsquo;s gauzy ballad into high-octane,Stones-y rock, complete with bird song, melodramatic strings and a gaudy-yet-appropriate guitar solo. A groove armada.

Ryan Adams
Lucky Now
The first taste of the North Carolina rocker&#039;s forthcoming 13th LP,Ashes &amp; Fire, carries a melodic echo of Neil Young&#039;s "Love Is a Rose." But the melancholy here runs much deeper. "I don&#039;t remember, were we wild and young?/All that&#039;s faded into memory," Adams sings gently over acoustic guitar, staring down some searing loss. Then Norah Jones enters with her piano like Mary Magdalene, pouring cool water on his wounds. Sad, simple, slight &ndash; and perfect. 

Teena Marie
Luv Letter
Voluptuously highlighting "the way I mix my metaphors" and quoting "Please Mr. Postman" over a full-bodied electro-funk groove, Lady T&#039;s posthumous album teaser exemplifies the eccentric richness lost with her 2010 passing. "Might just make you cry," she predicts, rightly. "Read it and weep."

Jamey Johnson
Macon
Coinciding with a fierce set at this year&#039;s Bonnaroo, Jamey Johnson offers another peek into his sprawling, two-CDThe Guitar Song, due in September. "Macon" gives voice to a wired, pedal-to-the-metal trucker achin&#039; for his woman, joining a venerable country tradition (see "Six Days on the Road," "Willin&#039;," etc.) over roadhouse piano, gospel backing singers and some hot-shit soloing. It feels like a Southern-rock classic straight out of the gate.

The Roots
Make My
The first taste of the Roots&#039; upcoming concept album is a melancholy ballad featuring a wistful Big K.R.I.T., nudged along by Kamal Gray&#039;s Fender Rhodes and ?uestlove&#039;s sauntering groove. "Make My" gestures back toCurtis Mayfieldand Gil Scott-Heron. The lyrics are strictly 21st century, though, as Black Thought contemplates suicide in the post-Drake style of angst rap: "If there&#039;s a heaven, I can&#039;t find the stairway."

Jamey Johnson feat. Alison Krauss
Make the World Go Away
The first single from Johnson&#039;s tribute LP to Hank Cochran tackles the late country songwriter&#039;s most widely covered number. It&#039;s closer to the 1965 Eddy Arnold hit than Elvis&#039; overcooked 1971 version, as Johnson&#039;s old-school romantic nihilism intertwines with Krauss&#039; hummingbird-precise voice. Framed by circling steel guitar, the plea for love in dark days feels as timely as a Twitter feed.

Big Boi feat Kelly Rowland
Mama Told Me
The OutKast MC&#039;s latest single rides an electro-funk groove so spry, Prince-ly and Eighties inspired that you can practically see Molly Ringwald roller-skating to it. Big Boi sounds typically light on his feet, speed-drawling comparisons between himself, Mozart and Van Gogh, while Kelly Rowland plays airy hook girl, reciting "Mama"&#039;s practical advice. It&#039;s neon lit pop fun &ndash; a straightforward crowd pleaser from a rap hall of famer.

Kanye West
Mama&#039;s Boyfriend
Update:  Kanye West says that the version of his song which was widely circulated  this week is"entirely bogus and unsanctioned"and features a fake  backing track.

Drake
Marvin&#039;s Room
Drake loads up on ros&eacute; and cognac, drunk-dials his ex and spills his guts over a noirishly spare beat. The result is bummer-rap-as-high- comedy, with Drake offering candid thoughts on his ex&rsquo;s new BF (he&rsquo;s not a fan) &ndash; and bragging about his busy love life.

Jerry Lee Lewis
Mean Old Man
Kris Kristofferson sang the original version of this country stomper, but its hard-edged crankiness is pure Jerry Lee. "If I look like a voodoo doll . . . who&#039;d rather bite you back than crawl, that&#039;s what I am," Lewis snarls on the single, the first from his upcoming album,Mean Old Man. Amid an intense beat and slide guitar from the Stones&#039; Ronnie Wood, the 74-year-old&#039;s voice is in prime form — pitch-perfect and tough as nails. Never has "Get off my lawn!" sounded this great.

Weezer
Memories
It&#039;s odd how Rivers Cuomo and Eminem always seem to drop new records at the same time. They both represent a lost golden era to their fanboy cult, and they get knee-jerk hostility from the same Stans who wildly overrated them 10 years ago. But the rest of the world still likes them as much as ever. "Memories," the first single from the forthcomingHurley, is a clever goof that skewers the Weezer cult by making fun of Nineties nostalgia. Over a chugging groove built on synths and power chords, Cuomo (who turned 40 in June) recalls "Pissin&#039; in plastic cups before we went onstage/Playin&#039; Hacky Sack back when Audioslave was still Rage." Now that Cuomo is a full-fledged adult charged with changing diapers and buying the family groceries, he&#039;s dreaming of the old days when people liked techno music, and he delivers the singalong chorus ("Memories make me want to go back there") with enough passion to make you think he&#039;s not entirely joking.

U2
Mercy
U2 have made their current European tour a testing ground for new material. The best of the new live songs is &quot;Mercy,&quot; cut during the sessions for 2004&#039;sHow to Dismantle an Atomic Bombbut not on the album. The band has reworked &quot;Mercy&quot; for the stage, turning it into a big bear hug of a ballad that almost sounds like it could have gone onJoshua Tree.&quot;You&#039;re going to kill me, and I want to die,&quot; Bono sings against the Edge&#039;s spacey arpeggios. &quot;We were meant for each other.&quot; Other tracks that thrilled fans this summer include the intensely rocking &quot;Return of the Stingray Guitar,&quot; the psychedelic &quot;Glastonbury&quot; and the starkly beautiful &quot;Every Breaking Wave.&quot; The latter recalls &quot;All I Want Is You,&quot; with Bono delivering dark poetry like &quot;The waves know we&#039;re on the rocks/Drowning is no sin.&quot; U2 say they have four separate albums in the works; if so, this is a good start.

Kacey Musgraves
Merry Go Round
Kacey Musgraves looks like a perfect country music ingenue &ndash; until you notice her nose-ring and the punky peroxide streak in her chestnut hair. The 24-year-old Texan&#039;s debut single is similar. It comes on gently &ndash; a banjo and a fingerpicked acoustic nudging a lovely singsong tune &ndash; but the story it tells is fierce and unblinking: a tale &nbsp;of small town America, where bleak prospects, bad marriages, and boredom are a young woman&#039;s birthright. "Mary, Mary, quite contrary/We&#039;re so bored until we&#039;re buried," Musgrave sings. It&#039;s as poetic and potent as any song released in 2012 &ndash; an instant classic, a "My Hometown" for millennials.

Das Racist
Michael Jackson
"I&#039;m fucking great at rapping!" roars Himanshu Suri on the hip-hop provocateurs&#039; new one. It&#039;s true &ndash; he and partner Victor Vazquez have only gotten cleverer since last year&#039;s name-making mixtapes. They go extra hard here, referencing Ritchie Valens and Oompa-Loompas over  a tweaked-out beat.

Yuck
Milkshake
The fuzz-rock revivalists slow down for a pretty, poppy ballad about nursing a  broken heart by getting stoned. "Milk&shy;shake," released as half of a one-off  single, probably would have been all over the radio 20 years ago - and the  melody is so sticky-sweet that you almost feel like it could do the same today.

Taylor Swift
Mine
Yes, we know: It&#039;s tough watching the kids grow up. And here&#039;s Taylor Swift, once the voice of heartbroken fifteen year olds everywhere now singing about living in sin with a college dude, imagining "a drawer of my things" at his crib while her dude assures her "we&#039;ll never make my parents&#039; mistakes." (Uh-huh.) Sure, it&#039;s formula: spare, acoustic guitar-driven opening; big fat chorus; lyrical perspective-shift, from hers to his, for the feel-good final verse. But it&#039;s expert formula, like vintage Fleetwood Mac reimagined for 2010 Nashville. And if she delivers the lines "We got bills to pay, we&#039;ve got nothing figured out" with an impossible amount of sugar, well, sometimes sugar helps.

R.E.M.
Mine Smell Like Honey
R.E.M. have found a new way to move forward: Sound like an awesome R.E.M. tribute band. "Mine Smell Like Honey" is allMonster-style guitar rumble, with a chorus straight outtaLife&#039;s Rich Pageantand Michael Stipe belting, "Dig a hole!/Dig it deeper, deeper!"

SuperHeavy
Miracle Worker
People don&rsquo;t often use the term "world music" anymore, but the first offering from Superheavy &mdash;Mick Jagger&#039;scollaboration with Dave Stewart, Joss Stone, Damian Marley and Indian theatrical composer A.R. Rahman &mdash; is some pretty worldly stuff. Jagger really goes for it, tasting every word he rolls out over the soul-splashed roots-reggae groove, which is cut with a gorgeous fiddle melody strung between Nashville and Istanbul. It&#039;s a summertime single built for every beach.

Surfer Blood
Miranda
The Florida indie-rock hookmeisters follow up on the power pop of their 2010 debut LP with thisPixies-flavored swarm of noisy, sugar-loaded melody from their October EP. That zero-gravity guitar breakdown at the midway point? Just sublime.

Maroon 5
Misery
Some people might have a hard time picking out "Misery" from a police line-up of Maroon 5 songs. Thankfully, Adam Levine helps us out by getting his ass kicked by a beautiful lady in the video. The song itself is classic M5: blindingly bright Jacksonian disco-pop masking brokenhearted lyrics that once again bridges the dance floor and the light rock station to turn your next elevator ride into a toe-tapping good time.

Deer Tick
Miss K
These Rhode Island guys usually deal in raw, country- flavored bummers. Here, they roll out breezy garage folk as singer John McCauley launches pickup-line Hail Marys; he&#039;s a nice New England boy who can sing "Talk dirty, turn me on, and let&#039;s get goin&#039; " without sounding like a knob.

Danny Brown and AraabMUZIK
Molly Ringwald
On this indie-rap summit, Motor City madman Danny Brown squawks over a menacing, hookless grind from buzzed-over producer AraabMUZIK, his flow relentless and, as usual, comically perverse: After lines riffing off "hair," "Cher," "day care," "Rocawear" and so on, he rhymes "watch Colbert" with "never sober." Heads up, Comedy Central.&nbsp;

Kelly Clarkson
Mr. Know It All
For her latest earworm, Clarkson narrows her octave range &ndash; noAmerican Idol glory notes here &ndash; and sasses a controlling man with double-entendres ("Baby, I ain&#039;t goin&#039; down") that up her R&amp;B appeal. The only problem?Bruno Marswants his "Just the Way You Are" hook back.

Perfume Genius
Mr. Peterson
On this ballad, Seattle newcomer Mike Hadreas conjures Morrissey as a haunted teen. "He made me a tape of Joy Division," Hadreas mewls, sketching a suicidal pedophile. Gus Van Sant: Your music supervisor needs to check this kid out.

Mary J. Blige feat. Drake
Mr. Wrong
Drama is stillMary J. Blige&#039;sbest friend on record. "Even though he breaks my heart so bad, we got a special thing going on," she cries out on the latest single fromMy Life II...The Journey Continues (Act I), telling the kind of addled-love story fit for her weary soul. The headstrong groove of Blige&#039;s early ballads syncs up surprisingly well with the hollowed-out R&amp;B of guest Drake, who sounds keenly aware, if not really conflicted, that the best kind of leading man in Blige&#039;s world is a lowdown creep: "They fall victim to my system/Guess I sure know how to pick &#039;em."

Paul Westerberg
My Road Now
The first Westerberg song in a while plays like a songwriter&#039;s card trick. It starts as a tender piano-ballad portrayal of an outsider, until the reveal comes at the chorus; Westerberg turns ornery, ordering the song&#039;s subject, again and again, to disappear. His ire barely changes the gentle tone.

Paul McCartney
My Valentine
Written for his new wife and performed at their wedding, this cocktail-blues piano ballad findsMcCartneyadrift in a Tin Pan Alley fantasy.Eric Clapton&rsquo;s acoustic jazz ripples add to the wee-small-hours intimacy. It&rsquo;s old guys being old guys, contentedly.

Beach House
Myth
The Baltimore dream-pop duo claim their new album was inspired by theCureand theBeach Boys, and that&#039;s pretty much what you get here: echo-caked, suburban shut-in guitar majesty drifting down Pout River on black-ice synth whoosh. "Help me to make it," Victoria Legrand whisper-yells. Wherever "it" is, she doesn&#039;t sound in a big rush to get there.

Elvis Costello
National Ransom
Wall Street deserves abuse in all forms, and on the title track from his upcoming T Bone Burnett-produced album, Costello delivers a punk-blues indictment of Goldman Sachs culture. &quot;National Ransom&quot; mixes rootsy stomp with squealing guitars, as Costello invokes the 1929 stock-market crash, rails against financial &quot;hocus-pocus&quot; and ends with a dire summation of the way we live now: &quot;We&#039;re working every day, paying off the national ransom.&quot; The result is a fiercesome rocker that revamps Elvis&#039; sound while reviving that classic Costello anger.

Adam Lambert
Never Close Our Eyes
This is pop music as simple arithmetic: A Bruno Mars tune plus Dr. Luke production plus anAdam Lambertvocal equals hit radio gold. "Never Close Our Eyes" is that calculated &ndash; right down to the lyric, which aims for the same party-at-the-edge-of-doom vibe as recent smashes like "I Gotta Feeling" and"Till the World Ends."("Why can&#039;t we just live life with no consequence/And always live in the now?" Lambert sings.) But there&#039;s no denying the pulsating electro drive of Luke&#039;s beat, or the blustery power of the melody and lyrics. As for Lambert: The magnificence of his strident vocals defies all formulas and precepts, mathematical and otherwise.

Kanye West feat. Pusha T
“New God Flow”
Kanyepreviewed his new G.O.O.D. Music single in abreathlessly barked quasi-freestyle a capellaat the BET Awards. The song itself has the same vibe of frantic triumphalism: a gospel sample, a bumrush beat and Kanye comparing himself to everyone from Lebron to Biggie to MLK to Rodney King and &ndash; in an even more audacious, "is nothing sacred"?! flourish &ndash; bragging that his new sneaker line is better than the Air Jordan. He&rsquo;s more than a New God. He&rsquo;s a Human Hashtag.

SpaceGhostPurrp
No Evidence
"Mystical bass vibrating like a beeper," this fringe rapper-producer out of Florida whispers on the first single from his upcoming debut,&nbsp;Chronicles of SpaceGhostPurrp. It could be his mission statement. A spaced-out thumper blending Nineties-era Oakland flows with Southern bounce, "No Evidence" has a stonefaced, intoxicating ambiance. Trippy, man.

Cloud Nothings
No Future/No Past
Back in January, Cleveland&#039;s Dylan Baldi put out a debut disc of bright and cute lo-fi pop-punk. On this first taste of his second LP, he fronts a full band, gets in a studio with aural verite production grandee Steve Albini and starts thinking dark and alluringly ugly. Baldi draws out his vowels likeThom Yorkeand yowls likeKurt Cobain, purging what sounds like a pretty scary case of the post-breakup blues over brutally molten guitar ooze. "Give up / We&#039;re through," he bellows. Whoever he&#039;s through with might want to call in a restraining order, just for good measure.

Maus Haus
No More Girls
Synth-rockers in T-shirts are always dour. Synth-rockers in satin shirts are always gleeful. Maus Haus, a scruffy San Francisco band, reverse this gulf with "No More Girls," jumpy rock-tronica that&#039;s exuberant with distortion and la-lala&#039;s.

Cee-Lo Green
No One&#039;s Gonna Love You
The Gnarls Barkley belter remains a master of the unexpected on this knockout reinvention of the Band of Horses ballad. Green meets the lyrics&#039; heartbroken drama head-on, transforming country rock into electro R&amp;B and revealing a buried soul classic.

The Rolling Stones
No Spare Parts
It&#039;s remarkable that theStonescan pull off country music, which they do via the strange alchemy of Jagger&#039;s twangy camp and Richards&#039; whiskey-stoned riffing. On thisSome Girlsouttake, from the forthcoming reissue, Mick plays it less over-the-top than he does on that LP&#039;s honky-tonk weeper, "Far Away Eyes," but with more cheek than the cover of Hank Williams&#039; "You Win Again," also included on the reissue. The ghost of Gram Parsons was hovering, and probably pouring shots.

Eminem
Not Afraid
"Let&#039;s be honest, that lastRelapseCD waseh," Eminem admits on "Not Afraid," his therapeutic new single. Even a sicko like Slim Shady couldn&#039;t stomach another humorless disc of Lindsay Lohan decapitation fantasies, so he scrappedRelapse IIto bring usRecovery, the apparently more introspective disc that&#039;s due this summer. "Not Afraid" reflects the new MO: It&#039;s part "fuck tha world" rage rap and part rehab-session group hug, complete with lyrics about kicking drugs and booze, and a chorus where Em sings, "Everybody come take my hand/We&#039;ll walk this road together." Over a dark, operatic beat, Eminem delivers rhymes that are typically acrobatic — and typically heavy-handed. But the anger has a gathering quality. Em &shy;reaffirms his commitment to his daughters, says he got sober in part to inspire his fans and promises to purge his craziness: "Time to exercise these demons/These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now."

Crystal Castles
Not in Love
"Not in Love" was a generic arena-rock tune by big-haired Eighties band Platinum Blonde. But with the help of the Cure&#039;s frontman, Canadian synth duo Crystal Castles have transformed it into an awesomely gothic, vocoder-slathered dance-floor monster. Shunning love but singing with lust, Smith wails asthe bass line rumbles and the keyboards go from spookily churchy to magnificently claustrophobic. This is Smith&#039;s catchiest, most immediately satisfying record since "Friday I&#039;m in Love."

Lee Ranaldo
Off the Wall
It&#039;s hard not to read theSonic Youthguitarist&#039;s new solo joint as a reckoning with SY founders Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon&rsquo;s marital split. "These days are so uncertain," Ranaldo sings. But with Wilco&#039;s Nels Cline helping him spool out riffs this serenely pretty, Ranaldo&#039;s future sounds assured.

Green Day
Oh Love
The only politics in the first single fromGreen Day&#039;s imminent three-album blitz are the sexually urgent kind, and the sole whiff of opera comes when Billie Joe Armstrong sings, "Oh love/ Won&rsquo;t you rain on me tonight?" &ndash; a neat allusion to the climax ofthe Who&#039;sQuadrophenia. Otherwise, this song is a tight, addicting bundle of pop-hook class and crunchy-punk fundamentals. The entire first verse is Armstrong singing like the stark soloJohn Lennon&ndash; just a bright, strident vocal and crisply strummed guitar. But when Armstrong&rsquo;s bandmates fall in around him, Green Day sound the way you originally loved &rsquo;em, and refreshed: heavier and hardened from their time in the trenches but back in the garage, ready for rapture.

R.E.M.
Oh My Heart
Even more than the brightly rocking "Discoverer," the newest glimpse at the upcomingCollapse Into Nowfinds R.E.M. in classic mode, employing a soft melody and a magnolia mandolin that cuts against an accordion. The lyrics suggest that the character from the 2008 Katrina lament "Houston" is coming back to New Orleans to start again &mdash; fitting, since "Oh My Heart" is about R.E.M. building something new from what they already know. "It&#039;s sweet and it&#039;s sad and it&#039;s true," Stipe sings, as if he&#039;s running down a checklist of what makes an R.E.M. song matter.

Kitty Pryde
Okay Cupid
High school-age mall employee and avowed Justin Bieber obsessive Kitty Pryde is this millisecond&#039;s internet-rap brush fire. But the Floridian&#039;s debut single is arresting well beyond its novelty appeal. Over a sumptuously screwed beat from Lil B and A$AP Rocky producer Beautiful Lou, she floats a drowsy, giggly love letter to her cigarette-breathed, drunk-dialing boyfriend ("you got my simpin&#039; and singin&#039; the Frank Ocean"), mixing adorkable lines about writing his name on her binder with asides about being cool with his recreational cocaine use. It&#039;s a balance of sugar and danger that goes back to the Shangri-Las. Though that sidelong "It&#039;s My Party" reference suggests she&#039;s more a Leslie Gore girl.

The Decemberists
One Engine
TheDecemberists&#039; Colin Meloy is clearly more of aMiddlemarchkind of guy than a young-adult sci-fi fan. But he also loves a literary challenge, and his contribution to the T Bone Burnett-producedHunger Gamessoundtrack not only nails the book&#039;s dystopic-frenzy/teen-torment vibe, it also invents a new genre: chase-scene indie rock. Over a heated folk gallop and some Edge-does-Shaft guitar peels, Meloy sings about breaking away from dark forces trying to "run you aground," something every state- sanctioned, murder-oriented game- show contestant &ndash; and American teenager &ndash; can keenly relate to.

Rihanna
Only Girl (In the World)
"Love me like I&#039;m a hot guy," begins Rihanna. Sadly, the rest of the lyrics are less gender-bendingly strange, and the trance beat won&#039;t keep you in the club unless someone else is paying for the drinks.

Major Lazer
Original Don
The reggae-loving alter egos of producers Diplo and Switch stomp back into the dancehall with a brutal groove: Thudding bass tones, distorted horns and hacked-up vocal fragments pile up into the perfect soundtrack for a dystopian rave.

Tennis
Origins
Produced by the Black Keys&#039; Patrick Carney, the new single from adorable husband-wife duo Tennis continues in the sunny-Sixties vein of their 2010 debut,Cape Dory; Alaina Moore brings it like a pink-chiffon teen diva over sweet, humming guitar hooks stacked high like a beehive hairdo.

Jay-Z and Kanye West
Otis
Jay-Z and Kanye West prove again that they&rsquo;re one of rap&#039;s all-time great tag teams &mdash; up there with Run-DMC, OutKast and EPMD &mdash; on this teaser fromWatch the Throne(due August 8th). West twists a few seconds of Otis Redding&#039;s "Try a Little Tenderness" into aBlueprint-style barrage, setting the stage for some slick collar-popping from Jay-Z ("Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth / I&rsquo;m about to call the paparazzi on myself"). Jay&rsquo;s performance, in turn, inspires Ye to step up his wordplay ("Luxury rap, the Hermes of verses / Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive"); the younger star sounds like he pulled an all-nighter trying to outdo his mentor&rsquo;s rhymes. They keep trading punchlines for three minutes, opting not to interrupt the fun with anything resembling a chorus. When the verses are packed with this much wit and style, who needs one?

Quincy Jones
P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)
This version of theThrillerkiller, cut by its producer for his new album, finds T-Pain splashing on the Auto-Tune like cheap cologne while Thicke channels Michael more straightforwardly. This at least beats Justin Guarini&rsquo;s version from Season One ofIdol.

Wild Nothing
Paradise 
There are a lot of indie-pop guys out there spooling out sad synth goo. But Brooklyn&#039;s Jack Tatum takes pouty art pop to new heights: Wild Nothing&#039;s forthcoming disc is a song cycle about the lunar cycle, and this single is a velveteen slab of New Wave disco &ndash; it&#039;s moony in every sense.

Weezer
Paranoid Android
Weezerdon&#039;t flex their art-rock muscles often, so it&#039;s understandable they&#039;d want to coverRadiohead&#039;s gloom anthem. At the end of their note-perfect rendition &mdash; recorded as a Web-only lark &mdash; someone says, "That was so cool." Well, sorta. But mainly boring. If they&#039;d made it sound like a Weezer song, that would have been so cool.&nbsp;

Katy Perry
Part of Me
The Official Katy PerryDivorceAnthem is a predictably effective piece of angsty dance-pop - it was co-produced by Dr. Luke and Max Martin, after all. It&#039;s also just plain predictable. The minor chords signal "dark, serious"; the lyrics supply tabloid bait ("You can keep the diamond ring/It don&#039;t mean nothing, anyway"). But Perry is best at fluffier stuff; she lacks the gravitas, and the lung-power, to drive the song home. Russell Brand: you can rest easy, mate.

Rita Ora
Party &amp; Bullshit
What would Biggie make of the way Roc Nation&#039;s latest signee repurposes the chorus of his gruff 1993 debut single into a fizzy Top 40 jam about getting trashed? Who knows&nbsp;&ndash; maybe he&#039;d race for the dance floor, pump a fist to the glossy guitars and shout along with the huge, ridiculous hooks ("When the sun sets, baby, on the avenue / I get that drunk sex feeling, yeah, when I&#039;m with you"). But he&#039;d probably just laugh.

Gossip
Perfect World
Beth Ditto loves romantic angst, and she loves the Eighties. On "Perfect World," she gets to do both, revving up the minor chords and the churning synths while belting out the best dance-rock melodrama Pat Benatar never got to sing.

Bobby Womack
Please Forgive My Heart
The rasp and strain in Bobby Womack&#039;s voice only make this abject apology &ndash; the first taste of the 68-year-old soul survivor&#039;s comeback LP &ndash; more powerful. Producers Damon Albarn and Richard Russell add electronic skitter, but they&#039;re smart enough to keep out of Womack&#039;s way.

The Rolling Stones
Plundered My Soul
The whole idea of an unreleased tune from theExile on Main Streetsessions is like hearing somebody dug up video footage of Jesus skateboarding. The Stones have always been circumspect to a fault when it comes to digging around in their vaults — even theirRarities 1971-2003compilation offered barely a scrap that fans didn&#039;t already own. But "Plundered My Soul" is an intact song, a relatively togetherExileouttake that chugs along in the torn-and-frayed R&amp;B mode of "Tumbling Dice" or "Soul Survivor," with heavily refurbished production and overdubs. Mick Jagger&#039;s vocal is brand-new, but that lyric is extremely 1972, as he moans, "I do miss your quick repartee," over guitars you could catch dysentery from. In other words, this is the real deal. Hit the halfpipe, Jesus.

Kanye West feat. Dwele
Power
After you&#039;ve sampled Can and compared yourself to Maya Angelou, how do you reach new heights of left-field craziness? How about rapping over King Crimson&#039;s paranoid prog jam "21st Century Schizoid Man"? Kanye&#039;s best single since "Stronger" rides a torrid whipsaw beat, as he takes on his spelunking media image, pinballing from self-aware ("I&#039;m an asshole") to defiant ("Kiss my asshole"). The sentiment is classic Kanye, but he hasn&#039;t melted down this brilliantly in a long time.

Coldplay
Princess of China
These new songs &ndash; all debuted live in recent months but not yet released in studio versions &ndash; suggestColdplay&#039;sforthcoming album may be more gritty, fun, strange and (yes) danceable than any so far: aZooropato theUnforgettable Fireof 2008&#039;sViva la Vida. "Hurts Like Heaven" opened their Lollapalooza set with a word rush that occasionally recalledLCD Soundsystem&#039;s"All My Friends," plus some outstanding guitar asides. Broadcast on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, "Charlie Brown" (not the Coasters&#039; 1959 hit, alas) triangulatesSpringsteen,U2andArcade Firein a hood-rat oratorio that roars even if Chris Martin&#039;s delivery feels too genteel. "Us Against the World" (debuted at the Rock am Ring festival in Germany) is an anthemic ballad with sweet harmony vocals from drummer/secret weapon Will Champion. Most interesting may be "Princess of China," with a dubby drum track so huge, it apparently blew out all the bootleggers&#039; mics in Nuremberg.

Freddie Gibbs feat. Young Jeezy and T.I.
Pull Up
The mixtape-slinging Indiana MC&#039;s speedy, almost jittery, rhymes about road head and pricey paint jobs couldn&#039;t be sharper, inspiring similarly hot runs from his bigger-name pals.

No Doubt
Push and Shove
On No Doubt&#039;s M.I.A.-tinged comeback hit, "Settle Down," Gwen Stefani reminded us how a true food-court princess gets down. The band calls this Diplo-produced track its "Bohemian Rhapsody." It stacks SoCal ska, a big alt-rock chorus, dancehall flow and electro undergroove until it sounds like two and a half No Doubt songs at once. Luckily, Gwen&#039;s beach-blanket B-girl flow ("Speeding it up like soca/ ...On another level like we doin&#039; yoga") holds this down to earth.

KT Tunstall
Push That Knot Away
On the first single from her third studio LPTiger Suit, the Scottish songstress ditches coffee-shop-flavored folk for a big dose of booming beats, electro textures and fuzzed-out bass. It&#039;s nice to hear Tunstall stepping out of her comfort zone: "Push That Knot Away" is a rousing, foot-stomping anthem that, while not as earworm-y as her breakout song &#039;Black Horse and the Cherry Tree,&#039; would easily get a crowd of drunks riled up at the pub. But lyrically, Tunstall is still mired in confessional singer-songwriter clich&eacute;s that are better suited for a therapist&#039;s office: "In the morning when you wake/It is a doorway for you to walk through to become what you make."

Frank Ocean
Pyramids
It begins in an Ancient Egypt straight out of a doofy prog-rock epic, complete with cheetahs, serpents, "Samson and his full head of hair" &ndash; Samson? In Egypt? &ndash; and "black queen Cleopatra." It ends up in a titty bar called "The Pyramid" where a stripper named, you guessed it, Cleopatra stalks the stage. In between there are groaning club beats, psychedelic guitar noodling, and lots of vague new-R&amp;B angst. It&#039;s never boring &ndash; a feat for a song that clocks in at just under 10 minutes. And Ocean&#039;s haunted croon has a way of turning the ridiculous into the sublime. But the Odd Future singer may have read too many blogs hailing him as a genius. It&#039;s a short trip indeed from Ocean&#039;s Pyramids to Spinal Tap&#039;s Stonehenge.

Kings Of Leon
Radioactive
Lesser men than the Kings of Leon might follow up an arena-rock blockbuster like 2008&#039;sOnly by the Nightwith a scrappy bid for street cred &mdash; something akin to the horny garage rock of their early days, perhaps. But the Followill boys have as much reverence for street cred as they do for wheat beer and William Tecumseh Sherman. The first single from their forthcoming fifth album is a rough beast that loads up on atmospherics without scrimping on ass-shaking potential or big, soulful ache. Caleb Followill dials up his bleary, ragged voice to Springsteen-level, growling about baptism and not forgetting your roots over a space-mountain jam that suggests the Allman Brothers produced by Brian Eno. A gospel swell appears toward the end of the song, upping the Jesus power. But as with everything the Kings of Leon do, the hot grind of the groove suggests that true redemption lingers in darker quarters.

Arcade Fire
Ready to Start
Relentless snare thwaps; a bass-line melody that would fit in an Eighties goth-pop tune. Enter Win Butler: "The businessmen drink my blood/Like the kids in art school said they would," Butler croons. (Damn you, art-school kids: always right!) But then Butler sings, "You say, &#039;Can we still be friends?&#039;&thinsp;" and a postgrad panic attack is twined with sweet heartache while synths conjure a time-bomb ticking. It&#039;s a glass-half-full take on dissatisfaction and the catchiest track yet from the forthcoming album.

Arctic Monkeys
Reckless Serenade
Over a "Sweet Jane" bass line, Alex Turner sings the praises of a girl so  awesome that "topless models doing semaphore wave their flags as she walks by  and get ignored." Sounds like a catch! The slinky surf-guitar melody is pretty  fetching too.

Odd Future
Rella 
Tyler, the Creator&rsquo;s crew returns with a middle finger to the usual targets, ears, gays and women included (&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get it poppin&rsquo; like MC Lyte around some dykes&rdquo;). It lacks the subtlety of jack hammering, though Left Brain&rsquo;s arrhythmic beat and the group&rsquo;s tongue-twisting

Paramore
Renegade
On the trimmed-down pop-rock band&#039;s new single, Hayley Williams flees a bad romance and wails with lovely, apropos anguish &ndash; so it&#039;s a bummer when she brags, "I&#039;m a renegade/It&#039;s in my blood," over a riff that&#039;s too tame to prove it.

Craig Finn
Rented Room
Earlier this year, while theHold Steadywere on vacation, their workaholic frontman, Craig Finn, decamped to Austin to record a low-key solo LP steeped in the literate roots rock of his native Midwest. This seven-inch single is our first glimpse: "Honolulu Blues" is an artfully shambling Seventies boogie with plenty of dust on its mudflaps and loads of Catholic guilt tearing at its transmission, while "Rented Room" is a post-breakup blues on which Finn rolls out elegantly frayed guitar majesty that suggests he&#039;s more than just a brilliant lyricist.

Lauryn Hill
Repercussions
Hill has been showing life on the road lately, but "Repercussions," apparently an old outtake, is disappointing — an undercooked jam about struggling through a world that&#039;s full of good intentions but devoid of hooks.

U2
Return of the Stingray Guitar
U2 have made their current European tour a testing ground for new material. The best of the new live songs is &quot;Mercy,&quot; cut during the sessions for 2004&#039;sHow to Dismantle an Atomic Bombbut not on the album. The band has reworked &quot;Mercy&quot; for the stage, turning it into a big bear hug of a ballad that almost sounds like it could have gone onJoshua Tree.&quot;You&#039;re going to kill me, and I want to die,&quot; Bono sings against the Edge&#039;s spacey arpeggios. &quot;We were meant for each other.&quot; Other tracks that thrilled fans this summer include the intensely rocking &quot;Return of the Stingray Guitar,&quot; the psychedelic &quot;Glastonbury&quot; and the starkly beautiful &quot;Every Breaking Wave.&quot; The latter recalls &quot;All I Want Is You,&quot; with Bono delivering dark poetry like &quot;The waves know we&#039;re on the rocks/Drowning is no sin.&quot; U2 say they have four separate albums in the works; if so, this is a good start.

Dr. John
“Revolution”
Lurching out of the speakers like a CPR&#039;ed Screamin&#039; Jay Hawkins jam, this is the first glimpse of the forthcoming collaboration between New Orleans rock &amp; roll royalty Dr. John and crate-digging guitarist-cum-producer Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys. "Blind eyes of justice," intones the Doctor before reciting a checklist of modern horrors, while horn chortles and a snappy Motown rhythm buoy the dark spirits. Then comes a trippy, waltz-tempo breakdown, and a suggestion that we "pray on it right now" &ndash; which he does, with a supremely badass Farfisa solo. Amen, brother.

Killer Mike
Ric Flair
Over a lip-smacking soul sample, the Atlanta rapper dispenses excellent baller advice ("You gotta politic your situations like Clinton") and laces the track with monologues from pro wrestler Flair: "I got more cars than most of you have friends." A studliness overload ensues.

Bonnie Raitt
Right Down The Line
The song is Scottish (a cover of Gerry Rafferty&rsquo;s 1977 hit); the groove is Jamaican (a gentle reggae skank); the percussion is Latin (timbales and conga); and the guitar-playing is classic rock by way of Chicago blues. The singer &ndash; and, of course, the guitarist &ndash; is Bonnie Raitt, who has been turning rootsy sounds into smart, moving and unflashy pop rock for decades. Like the rest of Raitt&rsquo;s catalog, this tune from her forthcomingSlipstreamLP is understated, almost to a fault. But Raitt&rsquo;s vocal hits just the right note of rueful worldly wisdom &ndash; and on her guitar solo, she shreds.

Reeve Carney feat. Bono and the Edge
Rise Above 1
Amid the all many disasters that beset the Broadway version ofSpider-Man, Bono and the Edge&#039;s songs emerge pretty much unscathed by critics. Now that the show has been revised and restaged, this centerpiece anthem of struggle over adversity may become a metaphor for its slog towards redemption. "Rise Above" is a trademark soaringU2ballad, with &nbsp;the elegant grandeur cranked up to Andrew Lloyd Weber levels. But show tunes need big voices too, and, singing next to Bono on this version from the forthcoming cast recording album, leading man Reeve Carney sounds like a nervous understudy.

Prince
RNR Affair
Rhythmically flimsy, despite guitar and synth tricks that flash back to "Raspberry Beret," this apparent one-off offers Eighties nostalgia to match the new mini-fro Prince is rocking. The song is a tale of a suburban girl colliding with a guy who believes in "jazz, rhythm &amp; blues, and this thing called soul." They live screamingly ever after, but the purple mountain majesty faded long ago.

Adele
Rolling in the Deep
With the follow-up to her Grammy-snagging 2008 album looming, this London pop-soul singer made a surprising choice for the disc&#039;s first single: "Rolling in the Deep" finds the 22-year-old in bluesy gospel mode, sounding powerful but not particularly pop. Starting with a stroked acoustic guitar, this breakup-mourning track builds to a stomping, hand-clapping climax that affirms the English knack for rejiggering the sound of American roots music. "I can&#039;t help feeling we could&#039;ve had it all," she wails, marking the death of a dream with audible wrath.

The Weeknd
Rolling Stone
"I&#039;m-a keep on smoking till I can&#039;t hit another note," sings R&amp;B buzz magnetAbel Tesfayeon this narcotic jam (whose title refers to the Earth, not this mag). Rather than slow him down, weed seems to give him vocal superpowers, as he sends his icy croon into the stratosphere over acoustic guitar.

Nicki Minaj feat. Lil Wayne
“Roman Reloaded”
The rapper Nicki Minaj: Remember her? Lately, Minaj has been making generic pop-diva moves, cutting a swath across red carpets and releasing bland club music (see "Starships"). "Roman Reloaded" is a welcome reversion: This is Minaj in her furiously witty Roman Zolanski alter-ego mode, slinging insults over an appealingly hard, spare Rico Beats track.Lil Waynedrops by to add some filthy rhymes, but the brightest punch lines belong to Minaj: "I guess I went commercial/Just shot a commercial/When I flew to the set, though/I ain&#039;t fly commercial."

Wild Flag
Romance
A study in supergroup chemistry: The first taste of theSleater-Kinney/ Helium/Minders alums&rsquo; debut LP (due in September) harnesses their old bands&#039; strengths into a fresh blast of giddy garage-psych ambition.

Nicki Minaj
Roman&#039;s Revenge
It&#039;s a match made in battle-rap heaven! On this single from Minaj&#039;s upcoming debut, two motormouths &ndash; both of whom know their way around a punch line, love goofy voices and suffer from severe cases of multiple personality disorder &mdash; team up for nearly five minutes of back-and-forth word-hurling. They rhyme like they&#039;re playing hot potato with a live grenade, and Swizz Beatz&#039;s hushed, chugging production throws the microphone viciousness into jarring relief. The common theme is anger toward female haters: Minaj tears into a "has-been" femcee who needs to "hang it up" (presumably Lil&#039; Kim, with whom she&#039;s been beefing for months). Eminem, meanwhile, rails against a woman who may be a metaphor for life itself. It&#039;s hard to say exactly why he&#039;s so mad at her &mdash; but he threatens to pee on her. Twice.

Nicki Minaj feat. Lil Wayne
Roman&#039;s Revenge
Weezy leaps on the craziest track from his prot&eacute;g&eacute;&#039;sPink FridayLP, an alter-ego spaz-out set over little more than bowed bass and skeletal percussion. Supplanting Eminem&#039;s bilious verses on the original version, Wayne sounds breathless, cackling, drunk on his new freedom. He boasts cleverly ("Life is a puzzle/Jigsaw/All I do is win/My name should be Victor") and rhymes the chorus, "Rahr! Rahr!/Like a dungeon dragon!" with &mdash; what else? &mdash; "Foie gras!/I hear you ducks is quackin&#039;!" Call him Victor.

Foo Fighters
Rope
Click to listen to the Foo Fighters&#039; "Rope"

The Decemberists
Row Jimmy
The bookish Portlanders cut a loose cover of the Grateful Dead&#039;s two-step, with Colin Meloy doing a spirited Jerry. It&#039;s like closing time at the library&#039;s special-collections room.

Cat Power
Ruin
Chan Marshall&#039;s career has been all about learning to move &ndash; from the alluringly static lo-fi mumblings of her Nineties albums to the shyly swinging Memphis soul of 2006&#039;sThe Greatest. Here she really gets truckin&#039;. "Ruin" is her poppiest, most straight-ahead song ever: a rolling piano and pushy drums drive lyrics about restless travel &ndash; from Saudi Arabia to Soweto to Belfast. But this isn&rsquo;t some eat-pray-love yuppie self-searching. What&rsquo;s all the ramble-tamble wandering taught her? "Some people ain&rsquo;t got shit to eat," she snaps. Looks like there&rsquo;s a new Bono in town.

Beyonce
Run the World (Girls)
From "Independent Women" to "Single Ladies," girl power has long beenBeyonc&eacute;&#039;s Topic A, and "Run the World (Girls)" is a blistering return to the theme. She forsakes fashionable sounds &mdash; no Eurodisco synths! &mdash; to belt over Diplo and Switch&#039;s ferocious dancehall beat. The message is party-hearty feminism. But withGaga,Britney, Katy,RihannaandTaylorall vying to be the queen of pop, you can bet B isn&#039;t looking to share the throne.

The Killers
Runaways
The first single from the firstKillersalbum in four years is an Eighties-rock fever dream that&rsquo;s crazily big, even by their grandiose standards: a Vesuvian gusher ofSpringsteenmythos, Toto-Journeypower hooks and singer Brandon Flowers&rsquo; unmistakable commitment to unmistakable commitment. Flowers leans into this tale of doomed American romance like he&rsquo;s the first rock &amp; roll dreamer &ndash; or maybe the last &ndash; who ever thought it&rsquo;d be a cool idea to describe blond hair blowing in the summer wind or to compare sex to a car engine. Kind of cool, kind of ridiculous, and Vegas all the way.

The Cars
Sad Song
It&#039;s as if they never left. "Sad Song" &mdash; the lead single fromMove Like This, the Cars&#039; first studio album in 24 years &mdash; opens with a rolling-machine groove that sparkles like 1978&#039;s "My Best Friend&#039;s Girl" with a fresh coat of chrome. But the Cars &mdash; especially singer-guitarist Ric Ocasek &mdash; were a deceptively dark ride, with a bleak undertow in Ocasek&#039;s songwriting and the band&#039;s sleek, noirish minimalism. "Too many clowns saying everything&#039;s all right . . . too many preachers saying what you should find," Ocasek sings, with stoic irritation, over the controlled cruise of drummer David Robinson, guitarist Elliot Easton and keyboard player Greg Hawkes. The chorus, in turn, is explosive irony. "It&#039;s just a sad song/It moves along," Ocasek promises as the band climbs and accelerates. The late singer-bassist Ben Orr would have brought extra sunlight in the harmonies. But in every other way, the Cars have pulled out of the garage in renewed vintage form.

Taylor Swift featuring The Civil Wars
Safe and Sound
Taylor Swift,&nbsp;alt-country hipster? Hearing is believing, and on this first&nbsp;cut fromThe Hunger Games&nbsp;soundtrack, Swift sounds the part, cooing a&nbsp;lover&#039;s lullaby over stark folk-twang accompaniment (courtesy of T-Bone&nbsp;Burnett), with harmony vocals from indie sweethearts The Civil Wars. Whether&nbsp;this is a one-off novelty, a trial balloon cred-move, or the stirrings of a&nbsp;"grown-up" style remains to be seen. In any case, it&#039;s Swift&#039;s prettiest&nbsp;ballad.

Clap Your Hands Say Yeah
Same Mistake
One of the past decade&rsquo;s biggest blog-buzz acts brightens up on their first single in four years, garnishing their guitars with cascading strings and disco-rock rhythms. Alec Ounsworth even smooths out his dying-cat vocals, sounding more like poppy solo Tom Verlaine than quirky Television Verlaine.

The Kills
Satellite
This scuzz-loving English blues-punk duo were on hiatus while singer Alison Mosshart howled alongside Jack White in the Dead Weather. Now they&#039;re back with bad vibes to burn and an even freakier new sound. On "Satellite," corrosive guitar skronk rolls out over a wickedly loping dub-reggae groove as Mosshart, singer-guitarist Jamie Hince and a spooky goth-gospel choir turn lyrics about a bootycall thwarted by crappy cellphone service into an S.O.S. from hell.

Jenny and Johnny
Scissor Runner
Real-life lovebirds Jenny Lewis and Johnathan Rice have been lurking in the background of one another&#039;s records since Lewis&#039;s 2006 albumRabbit Fur Coat, but the brisk and breezy "Scissor Runner" marks their first front and center collabo. And what&#039;s it about? Love, of course — but not the entirely healthy kind. Over bright, bounding, summery guitars, Rice sings, "She&#039;s an artist/ painting a portrait all over my heart" to which Lewis responds: "Colors bleeding/ so deceiving." The mix of tart sentiments and sparkling power pop is part of the song&#039;s sly charm.

Stevie Nicks
Secret Love
La Gold Dust Woman&#039;s first new music in a decade isa glimpse ofIn Your Dreams, a collaboration with Eurythmics&#039; synth-pop scientist Dave Stewart. (It&#039;s due in May.) "Come on, it&#039;s time to go upstairs" she begins over clipped Eighties drum thwaps and a witchy shroud of electronics, which give way to backward beats and a glassy guitar line. Her voice is strong and the come-on is inviting &mdash; at least until it evolves into something far more complicated. Romance is like that sometimes.

Kanye West feat. Beyonce and Charlie Wilson
See Me Now
"I&#039;m Socrates, but my skin more chocolaty," shouts Kanye, who goes on to detail several feats of attention-whore behavior — cruising in Ferraris, rocking fur coats, walking into high-end restaurants with no shoes on. But the sound is remarkably warm, a gospel-style mix of heartfelt crooning (from Beyonc&eacute; and ex-Gap Band singer Charlie Wilson) and plush accompaniment that&#039;s perfect for worshipping at the altar of Yeezy.

Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks
Senator
After the pathos of last year&#039;s triumphantPavementtour, Stephen Malkmus clears the air with a jovial rocker fromMirror Traffic, his superb upcoming collaboration with producerBeck. It&#039;s faster and lighter than most of the album, streamlining the Jicks&#039; mellow-gold West Coast approach while Malkmus races to the jokey hook line: "I know what the senator wants / What the senator wants is a blooow joooob." But there&#039;s also time for a poignantNeil Young-style guitar outro and a dazed half-spoken reflection about "smoking weed in our truck."

Madonna
Set the Right
A just-surfaced outtake from 2003&#039;sAmerican Life,&quot;Set the Right&quot; drops a simple, catchy tune over a blend of folky guitar and austere electronics. Less successful are Madonna&#039;s odd delivery (proper British vowels, casual Midwestern r&#039;s) and disingenuous claim that she won&#039;t take political sides.

No Doubt
Settle Down
The beat is Caribbean, with hints of Seventies funk and Eighties electro percolating up through the mix. There are burly rock power chords. The chorus is a big, delicious bubblegum flavor burst. In other words: The first newNo Doubtsong in nearly a decade sounds an awful lot like No Doubt a decade ago. What&#039;s surprising about "Settle Down," however,&nbsp;is how well the sound has held up: Strip some of the production gloss off "Settle Down," and it could be a Santigold record. But No Doubt are unapologetically themselves: still a lovably ditzy SoCal party band, right down to Gwen Stefani&#039;s surfer-chick beatitudes: "I&#039;m hella positive for real. . . . Nothing&#039;s gonna knock this girl down."

Sky Ferreira
Sex Rules
Teen dream Ferreira isn&#039;t bugged by being "not a girl, not yet a woman." Her latest synth-pop confection bounces like a Stacey Q jam &mdash; and big-ups both nooky and the Almighty: "I pity the fools who realize too late/Love, sex and God are great."

Ludacris
Sexting
On this Tiger Woods-skewering track, Ludacris plays a helpless, frantic sex addict, rhyming about "sitting in this rehab class / trying to get myself unhooked on ass" over simple, percolating drums. It&#039;s the rap equivalent of a late-night monologue joke: good for a laugh, but nothing you&sbquo;ll keep coming back to.

John Mayer
Shadow Days 
John Mayer&#039;s new LP was held for months while the singer recuperated from throat surgery, and the break seems to have given Mr. "David Duke cock" some time for self-reflection. "I&#039;m a good man with a good heart/Had a tough time, got a rough start," Mayer assures over country-tinged soft rock. You&rsquo;ve got to admire a man who takes the high road, and as Mayer&#039;s George Harrison-inscribed guitar melts into the sunset, his contrition is sympathetic.

Scissor Sisters
Shady Love
On their latest trash-disco single, the Sisters name-check Madonna and rhyme "Take me out to the movies" with "Feel all up on her boobies." The music sounds like it was recorded in a suburban basement with a Casio tape deck: awesome.

Florence and the Machine
Shake It Out
Florence Welch continues her superhero morph from arty rocker to pop diva with this mighty single. "All of the ghouls come out to play/And every demon wants his pound of flesh," she sings over a pregnant drone, like Glinda the Good Witch about to be very bad, indeed.

Rich Boy feat. Polow Da Don
She Luvs Me (She Luvs Mi Knot)
Rich Boy struck gold with producer Polow Da Don on 2006&#039;s "Throw Some D&#039;s." The pair hasn&#039;t been able to repeat the feat on any of their three subsequent singles together, including 2007&#039;s cheery love jam "Good Things" and 2009&#039;s art-damaged Weezy-rip "Drop." "She Luvs Me (She Luvs Mi Knot)" switches his style up yet again for Polow&#039;s excellent approximation of a dancehall-infused Timbaland beat — and Rich Boy&#039;s unfortunate approximation of Timbaland&#039;s half-baked rapping. And a "fuck your couch" reference in 2010 is just inexcusable.

Big Boi and Theophilus London, feat. Tre Luce
She Said OK
A slow, smeary funk ode to things that get blown &ndash; such as pot and Big Boi. Not new territory, but his pimpadelic cool sucks you in.

Lil Wayne feat. Drake
She Will
The latest leak from the forthcomingCarter IVis a case of the mentor (Lil Wayne) trying on the style of the protege (Drake). "She Will" is emo-rap, a moody ode to a loose woman, complete with a brooding beat by T-Minus and plaintive chorus rap-crooned by Drake himself. But in the verses, Wayne can&#039;t repress his playful nature, or his way with punchlines. "Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack," Weezy raps." I&#039;m all about &#039;I&#039; &ndash; give the rest of the vowels back."

Limp Bizkit
Shotgun
The new jizz-oint from Bizkit&#039;s first disc in six years clings defiantly to the frat-tastic funk of circa-1999 rap rock &mdash; complete with "a shout to you ladies  with the hot tits." So, welcome back Fred Durst, a 40-year-old man who still says "tits."

Leonard Cohen
Show Me The Place
Cohen&#039;s first album since 2004, due in January, is calledOld Ideas, and&nbsp;that&#039;s pretty much what its first official song is all about: a 77-year-old&nbsp;folk O.G. getting in touch with the essentials of his songwriting. His&nbsp;Cookie Monster-does-Deuteronomy baritone has long transcended ephemeral&nbsp;considerations like melody and tone, and the somber piano and stark&nbsp;religious imagery &ndash; warmed by a French-Canadian parlor-folk accompaniment&nbsp;and background vocals from old pal Jennifer Warren &ndash; will remind many of&nbsp;"Hallelujah." "Show me the place where the word became a man / Show me the&nbsp;place where the suffering began," Cohen growls, bringing to mind hard-nosed&nbsp;meditations on mortality by fellow septuagenariansBob DylanandPaul Simon.&nbsp;He&#039;s staring down the eternal with unblinking honesty and a primordial sense&nbsp;of purpose.&nbsp;

The White Stripes
Signed D.C.
Jack and Meghave called it quits, but there&#039;s good news: Third Man  Records plans to gradually roll out a load of unreleased White Stripes  songs. The newest offerings &mdash; covers cut in 1997 &mdash; prove the Stripes  sounded like themselves from the get-go: On Love&#039;s druggy ballad  "Signed D.C.," Jack moans about addiction over a beat that&#039;s minimalist  even for Meg. Their take on Otis Redding&#039;s "I&#039;ve Been Loving You Too  Long" is livelier: Jack&#039;s vocals are sweet, but his fuzzed-out guitar  suggests deeper torment. More, please.

Avicii
“Silhouettes”
Swedish DJ Avicii typically purveys utter gush, but on "Silhouettes" his prancing synth chords and euphoric builds are tauter than usual, and less over-the-top. Odd that Salem Al Fakir croons he&#039;s "never getting back to the new school" over circa-&#039;98 trance-pop, though.

The Shins
Simple Song
It&#039;s been five years and one new band (Broken Bells, his Danger Mouse collaboration) since James Mercer made aShinsalbum. After overhauling the group&#039;s lineup, he&#039;s finally made another, and this spangled, chin-up-kid anthem is the first taste. Mercer gets his reveries on &ndash; "When I was just nine years old/I swear that I dreamt/Your face on a football field" &ndash; amid multitracked vocals and prog-rock frippery, while guest Shin Janet Weiss pounds out a Phil Spector faux-tango with Keith Moon flourishes. It&#039;s pretty magnificent, and that ascending melody will trail you like a double-espresso buzz.

Jack White
“Sixteen Saltines”
"Love Interruption," the first single fromJack White&#039;s forthcoming album, was a fine slice of Lee Hazlewood-flavored country soul. But this, friends, is the shit. From the second that opening power chord punches into your skull like Javier Bardem&#039;s bolt gun fromNo Country for Old Men, it&#039;s on: Jack White, solo artist, spitting out tweaked, tortured metal-esque garage rock just like he did in the old days. If there are acoustic string instruments here, as there were on hisrecentSaturday Night Liveperformanceof the song, they are barely in evidence. What you get is a firestorm of electric-guitar noise cloaked in Hammond-organ smoke, with a crushing groove that never gets too busy. Meg White isn&#039;t here, but her spirit lingers.

Courtney Love
Skinny Little Bitch
The Nineties are so hot right now, it&#039;s no surprise that Courtney Love is staggering back to the spotlight with a &#039;Get off my lawn&#039; rant aimed at younger rock chicks. &#039;Skinny Little Bitch&#039; is so 1996 it hurts — Courtney tries to replicate Garbage circa &#039;Stupid Girl,&#039; with the rhythm section lurching like Nirvana&#039;s &#039;Dive&#039; and a melody nicked from Sonny and Cher&#039;s &#039;The Beat Goes On.&#039; Her voice is wobbly, but she holds it together for this two-chord stomp. The new version of Hole isn&#039;t much of an upgrade over the last one — despite all the fanfare over hotshot guitarist Micko Larkin, he&#039;s barely audible here. It&#039;s all Courtney, slurring &#039;I could kick your scrawny ass&#039; at a rival who&#039;s a &#039;nasty piece of work.&#039; Her put-downs might be lame, but at least they&#039;re comprehensible. From Courtney Love, that&#039;s quite a feat.

Radiohead
Skirting on the Surface (Live)
Radioheadhave been peppering the set lists on their latest arena tour with some  new works in progress &ndash; prime hunks of red meat for fans left ravenous  by last year&#039;s all-too-briefThe King of Limbs. One highlight,  "Identikit," is a sly siren song: "When I see you messing me around, I  don&#039;t want to know," Thom Yorke warns, nimbly weaving his falsetto  around twin drummers Phil Selway and Clive Deamer&#039;s hiccupping patterns.  "Skirting on the Surface," known to hardcore fans from Yorke&#039;s 2009  Atoms for Peace tour, is even better &ndash; a spooky semi-acoustic ballad  with a juicy low end, like a paranoid android that knows how to move on  the dance floor. Both tunes feel warmer and easier to love than much ofKing of Limbs. Can&#039;t wait to see how they mutate and bloom when Radiohead get back to a studio.

Adele
Skyfall
Adele has been compared to everyone fromAretha FranklintoEtta James, but her real spiritual forbear may be Shirley Bassey, the brassy, leather-lunged, slightly schlocky Welsh songstress best known for belting out three James Bond theme songs, including the indelible "Goldfinger." So "Skyfall," the title song from the forthcoming 23rd Bond film, feels natural, inevitable: Adele is a born Bond Theme Girl, with the voice, and the flair for melodrama, that the job demands. Written by Adele and her "Rolling in the Deep" collaborator Paul Epworth, "Skyfall" sounds like the product of a computer algorithm, designed to produce the Platonically-ideal Bond theme. It has a slow-boiling tempo; a grandly arcing melody line; strings and brass that shiver, gust, and swoop; and a bombastic, romantic lyric ("Let the sky fall/When it crumbles/We will stand tall/Face it all together"). Adele sings magnificently, but the thing feels a bit too worshipful, not quite goofy enough. This is Bond &ndash; James Bond &ndash; we&#039;re talking about, the campiest screen hero in history. Adele and Epworth might have leavened their heart-on-sleeve with a bit more tongue-in-cheek.

Crocodilies
Sleep Forever
On the new single from these California fuzz-rockers, Crocodiles deliver another serving of bleary-eyed shoegaze, mixing ghostly harmonies that sound like Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers singing from the bottom of a well with the pitch-black scuzz of The Jesus and Mary Chain. "I will love you till the sky above you shatters," croons Charles Rowell on the high-arcing chorus — just before a blast of distortion-drenched guitar that sounds like exactly that.

Grizzly Bear
Sleeping Ute
On the first taste of the follow-up to 2009&#039;s meticulously gorgeousVeckatimest, theJay-Z-approved indie band sends a bolt of electric guitar cutting through a summer storm of synths and unsettled percussion. "I can&#039;t help myself," sings Daniel Rossen, the higher-pitched songwriting yin to founder Ed Droste&#039;s yang, before a ravishing, fingerpicked acoustic breakdown settles in. What&#039;s he going on about? Bet you won&rsquo;t mind listening 10 more times to figure it out.

Miley Cyrus
Smells Like Teen Spirit (Live)
Performed in Ecuador (born for the Internet), this embodies the kind of slimy pop serendipity that would makeKurtlaugh, and then cry, and then laugh again (then sleep, probably). Miley may have the least Cobain-ian vision of teen spirit ever. But she rides it like a demon steed straight to karaoke hell.

Brad Paisley
Southern Comfort Zone
The title track from Paisley&#039;s forthcoming LP shows Nashville&rsquo;s great ambassador affirming his roots while courting the planet. Where 2010&#039;s "This Is Country Music" seemed a little defensive, this big-tent cultural fete namechecks NASCAR, Billy Graham and "Ring Of Fire" over arena-rock with steel-guitar detailing. The gist is that home is great, but sometimes a brother needs to get out of his "Southern comfort zone." The allusion to "I Still Haven&#039;t Found What I&rsquo;m Looking For" in the second verse is sly. And the choir singing "Dixie" while he plays guitar god is brilliant. A bit like "Niggas In Paris" for good ol&rsquo; boys.

Taylor Swift
Speak Now
Taylor repurposes the &quot;she wears short skirts&quot; melody from &quot;You Belong With Me&quot; in order to bust up a wedding,Graduate-style. But freeing the man of her dreams from bad-marriage hell is almost an afterthought on &quot;Speak Now&quot;; the real fun is listening to her unload her simile nail gun at the disgustingly perfect bride-to-be &mdash; a mean girl who &quot;floats down the aisle like a pageant queen&quot; in a &quot;gown shaped like a pastry.&quot; And all of it comes off catchy as heck and cute as a button. The girl knows how to spin hate into cotton candy.

Lenny Kravitz
Stand
The first single fromKravitz&#039;sBlack and White America, due out August 30th, borrows the melodic phrasing of vintage crankyElvis Costello, yet still somehow sounds like a groovy windows-down, volume-up summer hit. It&#039;s fluffy stuff, but also a welcome curveball.

Nicki Minaj
Starships
Minaj&rsquo;s latestRoman Reloadedcut is pure beach party trance-rap &ndash; clearly an apologetic offering to the gods of Pop Normalcy, after a Grammy performance that made Middle America feel like it was being home invaded by the demon spawn of Linda Blair and Lady Gaga. Gaga producer Red One pitch-adjusts Nicki&rsquo;s voice sky-high and smears it in synth sleaze, as she big-ups Bud Light and parties like a very contrite rock star on the fifty-yard line of pop.&nbsp;

Gym Class Heroes feat. Adam Levine
Stereo Heart
Travie McCoy doesn&rsquo;t work in a specific genre &ndash; unless "crossover" is a genre. And this potential summer smash, cut with his band Gym Class Heroes, highlights his skill at pop that floats between styles. "Stereo Heart" is a little bit hip-hop, a little bit disco, a little bit dark-synthed club music; and, withAdam Levinereplacing Bruno Mars on the hook, it&rsquo;s a lot like Travie&rsquo;s hit "Billionaire." When Levine croons, "Make me your radio," it also (unintentionally?) channelsJoni Mitchell&#039;s 1972 folk-pop masterstroke "You Turn Me On, I&#039;m a Radio." Travie contains multitudes.

B.o.B. feat. Lil&#039; Wayne
Strange Clouds
On the kickoff to his second LP, the Atlanta rapper slings references to Nancy Kerrigan,&nbsp;Inception&nbsp;and&nbsp;Top Chef&nbsp;over a blippy dubstep beat from Dr. Luke. Wayne drops a wink-nudge verse about getting blitzed, but it&rsquo;s B.o.B who lights up with a charming, tenacious flow.&nbsp;

Green Day
Stray Heart
On this nugget from&iexcl;Dos!&ndash; the forthcoming second installment inGreen Day&#039;s trilogy of albums &ndash; Billie Joe Armstrong makes like a boy idol over Fifties-tinged blitzkrieg bubblegum, unironically crooning fluffyy school-age angst like "Ohhh, you&#039;re the only one that I&#039;m dreaming of/Your precious heart." The buoyant bass line is a direct nick fromthe Jam&#039;s blue-eyed mod classic "Town Called Malice," and the feral wolverine guitars raise rockabilly Hades all over your bedroom. The focused ruckus suggests&iexcl;Dos!will continue&iexcl;Uno!&#039;strick of trading dystopian Seventies-style rock opera for Sixties-style rock &amp; roll idealism. It&#039;s not their most high-concept experiment, but it&#039;s a pretty fun one.

Beck
Summertime
This crunchy blast of blues-rock is for the geeks, the manga-loving nerds, the people whose favorite Beck album isStereopathetic Soulmanure. Beck goes back to his lo-fi roots for this tune that he wrote under the guise of Sex Bob-omb, Michael Cera&#039;s fictional band in the upcoming movieScott Pilgrim Vs. The World. Actors overdubbed several Beck-penned songs for the film, but he takes the reins on the soundtrack for this fun reminder of how he once ruled over something called alternative rock.

Radiohead
Supercollider
Sorry,Radioheadfans &mdash; the band swears the only sequel you&#039;re going to get toThe King of Limbsis these tunes. Both are superb electro ballads that would have fitKing&#039;s  moodier second half. "Supercollider" is familiar from the group&#039;s  epochal 2008 tour; the stuttering drums on the new "The Butcher" evokePrince&#039;s "Housequake," while Thom Yorke layers harmonies into a celebration of paranoid dread.

Das Racist
Swate
Six heavy-lidded minutes of Bollywood-steeped wisecracking from Brooklyn&#039;s reigning rap ironists. They reference Marxist theorist Slavoj Žižek as casually as most rappers reference cheeba. They also reference cheeba.

Chris Brown
Sweet Love
Moving from the club to the bedroom, Brown oozes loverman charm and let-it-all-out lustover tinkling keyboards. He also gets so detailed about his lady-pleasing techniques, any video accompaniment would be almost pornographically unnecessary.&nbsp;

The Chemical Brothers
Swoon
Beloved British rave stalwarts rock the melancholy with indecipherable vocals and an awesomely squishy, spangled, descending-tone sample that hits your gut like cresting a roller coaster. A tune that definitely lives up to its title, for a world that needs to spend some time in the chill-out room.

Discodeine ft. Jarvis Cocker
Synchronize
Jarvis goes disco! On the latest in a stellar year&#039;s worth of singles from DFA Records (LCD Soundsystem main man James Murphy&#039;s label), Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker teams up with French house luminary Pilooski&#039;s part-time duo Discodeine for a groove as suave as the vintage Chic records that clearly inspired it. Jarvis&#039;s foggy croon sounds perfect over cross-cutting strings and explosive drum fills.

Will.i.am feat. Jennifer Lopez and Mick Jagger
T.H.E. (The Hardest Ever)
Who but Will.i.am could getMick Jaggerto rap &ndash; yes, rap &ndash; over a glitzy Ibiza beat in 2011? Who else would even think of such a wonderfully batshit idea? On the first single from his forthcoming solo LP#willpower, the Black Eyed Peas mastermind strews dodgy rhymes ("I woke up in the morning/Hard like morning wood in the morning") over diamond-bright synths, whileJ. Lohandles the efficient hook. It all feels a bit perfunctory &ndash; except for Mick&#039;s guest verse, a kitschy delight delivered in a "Midnight Rambler" snarl.

The Go! Team
T.O.R.N.A.D.O.
This U.K. band, known for head-snapping sound collages, returns with a mix of schoolyard chants, turntable scratches and horn blasts. It&#039;s deafening and funky &mdash; like a drill team strutting into a funnel cloud.

Van Halen
Tattoo
The reunitedVan Halen&#039;srecent New York gig showed that the guys could share a stage without mauling each other, and rock out like it was 1984. On their new single, all the components are in the right place, too: those aerodynamic harmonies,Eddie Van Halen&rsquo;swhining-dragon guitar solo, his brother Alex&#039;s pole-dancing grooves andDavid Lee Roth&#039;sneon-peacock strut. Sadly, this slow-boiling ode to body ink never really hits liftoff. Roth savors lines like "Show me your dragon magic/So auto-bio-graphic," and brags that he has the number of his uncle&#039;s union chapter emblazoned on his shoulder. (Diamond Dave is a lefty! Who knew?) But if Van Halen had dropped "Tattoo" into one of their Eighties shows, you might&#039;ve headed to the concession stand for a Coke, or wondered if theirs was wearing off a bit. (In fact, the song&#039;s main riff sounds like it was borrowed from "Down in Flames," a late-1970s live cut.) Still, it&#039;s great to have you back and windmill-kickin&#039;, fellas.

The Vaccines
Teenage Icon
These Brit-pop guys are like theStrokeswith a better sense of humor. "I always figured I was somebody-in-wait" singer Justin Young faux-bemoans on this ode to not quite being almost famous. Watch out, sport &ndash; with songs this catchy, you&nbsp;might be.

Britney Spears
Telephone
Before Lady Gaga conquered the Fame Monster, she was a songwriter who pitched &#039;Telephone&#039; to Britney Spears. This Auto-Tuned Britney demo is more bare-bones, but it holds up against Gaga&#039;s version anyway. Even before its authenticity was confirmed, any seasoned Britneyologist could tell it was our girl singing, with her distinctive vocal tics and barely repressed rage.

Sleigh Bells
Tell &#039;Em
This M.I.A.-approved noise-pop band lives up to months of buzz with its debut single: Mixing angelic vocals with grinding synths and scorched bass, it&#039;s a body-shaker that sounds like a choir girl showing up to a street fight with a howitzer and a holster full of lasers. Danceable lasers.

M.I.A. feat. Nicki Minaj
Teqkilla (Lost my fone out wiv Nicki Minaj Remix)
An M.I.A. song rarely lacks bad-chick attitude and with its piercing storm-siren beat and its stoner-baiting shout-out to that &#039;sticky-sticky icky-icky,&#039; this remix is no exception. Nicki Minaj drops by to lend &#039;Teqkilla&#039; a shot of her street-sweet swag: &#039;I never, ever take &#039;em to my mattress,&#039; she raps, sounding like she&#039;s had a few. &#039;I tell &#039;em, &lsquo;Meet me in the sky, yeah, that&#039;s my address.&#039;&#039; Watch out for these two.

Crookers feat. Style of Eye and Carli
That Laughing Track
From the dudes behind that toasty remix of Kid Cudi&#039;s "Day &#039;N&#039; Nite" comes this electro-house ruckus. Built around insane laughter and rubbery beats, it targets that wee-hours moment in the club when you think your head might explode. Then the DJ drops this, and it does.

The Beach Boys
That&#039;s Why God Made The Radio
"I just wasn&#039;t made for these times," sang Brian Wilson on a recent episode ofMad Men, soundtracking Roger Sterling&#039;s old-school LSD trip. And so remains the master songsmith on this single &ndash; the title track of a forthcoming reunion LP with survivingBeach BoysMike Love and Al Jardine &ndash; which sounds beamed in from a parallel universe where the calendar stopped around 1965. "Tuning in the latest star/From the dashboard of my car/Cruising at seven/Push-button heaven," keen the vets over vintage mid-tempo West Coast surf-pop, voices remarkably intact, criss-crossing like skyrockets during the title-chanting harmony cascade at the end. Kinda cosmic, sorta corny, undeniably beautiful.

Red Hot Chili Peppers
The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie

Paul Simon
The Afterlife
The narrative wit is sharp on the second track from Paul Simon&#039;s forthcomingSo Beautiful or So What(due in April): Some dude gets to heaven, fills out forms, waits in line, and tries, unsuccessfully, to mack on some girl. And when it comes time to explain his mortal life to the Almighty, he can only splutter rock &amp; roll gibberish. "Lord, is it &#039;be bop a lula&#039;?" the unnamed sap implores. "Or &#039;ooo papa doo&#039;?" Packed with internal rhymes, Simon&#039;s verses flow like butter over supple lines by Cameroonian guitar master Vincent Nguini and Jim Oblon&#039;s syncopated grooves. Simon saysSo Beautiful or So Whatreminds him of his sparsely produced solo debut, 1972&#039;sPaul Simon. But in its mix of wry, mellow pop and African guitars, "The Afterlife" echoesGraceland. It&#039;s world-music fusion that&#039;s as off-handedly awesome as a kimchi hot dog.

Mark Ronson feat. Spank Rock and Kyle Falconer
The Bike Song
Ronson delivers a breezy summer single just under the wire, pairing loose-limbed funk with a creamy tune about cruising through the city on two wheels &mdash; and refusing to grow up.

The Gaslight Anthem
The Boxer
New Jersey&#039;s most buzzed-over young band drops a focused blast about a downtrodden creative type who finds "bandages inside the pen and the stitches on the radio." A hint of what&#039;s to come on Gaslight&#039;s upcomingAmerican Slang, "Boxer" is one of the band&#039;s most immediately likable tunes yet: scrappy, catchy and hyperpassionate.

Radiohead
The Butcher
Sorry,Radioheadfans &mdash; the band swears the only sequel you&#039;re going to get toThe King of Limbsis these tunes. Both are superb electro ballads that would have fitKing&#039;s moodier second half. "Supercollider" is familiar from the group&#039;s epochal 2008 tour; the stuttering drums on the new "The Butcher" evokePrince&#039;s "Housequake," while Thom Yorke layers harmonies into a celebration of paranoid dread.

Bob Mould
The Descent
TheH&uuml;sker D&uuml;/Sugar vet drops a blast of hook-chiseled guitar noise with rueful lyrics that lead to a refrain of "Can I try to make it up to you somehow?" As guiltpunk purges go, it&#039;s not the H&uuml;skers&#039; "I Apologize," but it&#039;s a nice return to form.

Nas
“The Don”
All it takes is the right beat to send Nasir Jones back to 1994. On the latest preview of the Queens lyricist&#039;s forever-forthcoming new album, a stammering dancehall sample (hacked up by right-hand man Salaam Remi and the late Heavy D) provokes a cascade of self-mythologizing scenes. "Fuck sadness,"Nasargues. "Had this been you having this lavish, habitual happiness, at me you wouldn&rsquo;t look backwards." But looking backward is what he does most deftly on "The Don," with a concise portrait of the artist as a young man: "I used to listen to that Red Alert and &#039;Rap Attack&#039;/I fell in love with all that poetry, I mastered that." Bring on the album.

M. Ward
The First Time I Ran Away
This teaser from Ward&rsquo;s sixth LP indulges in atmospherics so deeply that he nearly dissolves in them, lapsing into ethereal oohs and a murmured incantation about a waterfall. Ward sheds his old-bluesman tics for a soul-folk croon &ndash; and the guitars, as usual, are sublime.&nbsp;

Olivia Tremor Control
The Game You Play Is in Your Head, Parts 1, 2 &amp; 3
The reunited Georgia psych-pop crew&#039;s first single since the Nineties is a candy-colored daydream in three acts, totaling five minutes of exhilarating melodies and home-brewed sound effects. What a sweet surprise.

Gayngs
The Gaudy Side of Town
No joke: Bon Iver&#039;s Justin Vernon sheds his folkie beard to croon this atmospheric slow-jam with Midwestern indie band Gayngs. They drip so much coital energy Prince nearly got onstage with them. But, no, he said — they don&#039;t need me. He was right.

Japandroids
The House That Heaven Built
Noise-rock bros burn like the Replacements at their most earnestly hopped up."If they try to slow you down/Tell &#039;em all to go to hell," yowls Brian King, riding a ragged guitar surge. Invigorating stuff &ndash; and a fine soundtrack to your next speeding ticket.

Slaughterhouse
The Illest
The typical mood of this crew (which is signed toEminem&#039;sShady Records) is lunchroom-table dour. Here, though, while a sampledBiggieshouts a mantra ("Lyrically, I&#039;m untouchable"), member Royce da 5&#039;9" points a way forward: "We not social/On Twitter, we block Oprah and Deepak Chopra." Guys! Was that . . . a joke?

Kanye West
The Joy
Our first taste of the Kanye-Jay collaboration album (due next year) celebrates some simple pleasures: a dusty Curtis Mayfield sample, a butter-dripping beat, and Jay waxing nostalgic about listening to his mama&#039;s shit when he was on his pajama shit. This isn&#039;t about conquering the world, just watching it spin.

The Coup
The Magic Clap
Boots Riley, a spokesman for Oakland&#039;s Occupy movement, leads his long-standing agitprop hip-hop crew through a soul-shouted jock-rap bleacher cheer for the 99 percent. It&#039;s a political party in fine PE tradition for sure: cap salaries; fix the 14th Amendment; "tell Homeland Security we are the bomb."

The Mars Volta
“The Malkin Jewel”
Lurching into an impossibly spastic reggae groove (uh, is that a banjo?), this mutant jam shifts midway into a spooky carnival scene, with Cedric Bixler-Zavala&#039;s shivering whispers turning to rabid snarls, sultry croons, and heavy-metal howls. Still hard rock&#039;s most fascinating sonic freak-show.

The National
The Rains of Castamere
As fantasy fan wish-fulfillment goes, the morose Brooklyn rockers&#039; spare, deadly dull go at aGame of Thronesbattle ballad ranks somewhere south of spotting Peter Dinklage walking the dog.

Kendrick Lamar feat. Dr. Dre
The Recipe
You might get a contact high from this. Dr. Dre prot&eacute;g&eacute; Lamar&rsquo;s wafting number has rolling boulders for a beat, lines about sunlight slanting through shades and Dre explaining, "How many ways am I killin&#039; &#039;em? Shit, right around a billion."

The Situation
The Situation
And you thought Pauly D would be the firstJersey Shorestar to rap. Sorry, Pauly — the Situation pulled the robbery! Sitch raps with DJ Class, Fatman Scoop and the Disco Fries, complete with the party chant "Whoa, we got a Situation." It probably sounds fine when you&#039;re beating the floor at Bamboo in your "I Heart House Music" t-shirt — especially after a jug of Ron Ron Juice.

Arcade Fire
The Suburbs/Month of May
"2009, 2010/Wanna make a record how I felt then," sings Win Butler on "Month of May." As usual, the Arcade Fire frontman is feeling a lot. Childhood nostalgia, suburban ennui, parenthood, war, death — these are just some of the themes crammed into the songs on Arcade Fire&#039;s fabulous new double-sided 12-inch single. "The Suburbs" is a piano-fueled shuffle that starts dreamy and then turns vaguely paranoid as it looks back at a teenage wasteland with longing and amusement: "You always seemed so sure/That one day we&#039;d be fighting/In a suburban war. . . ./But by the time the first bombs fell/We were already bored." "Month of May" is a furious punk boogie about disaffected kids that suggests a Crazy Horse-backed Neil Young shaking a fist at America&#039;s listless youth. Both songs reveal a band looking more and more like Springsteen&#039;s and U2&#039;s rightful heirs, with an undiminished appetite for grandeur — big themes, big emotions and an even more potent sound.

Guided By Voices
The Unsinkable Fats Domino
A cryptic ode to an iconic rock pianist, the first new tune from the reunited band&#039;s hailed 1993-96 lineup is bouncy, brief and brimming with playful rhymes. If you love oneGBVsong, you&#039;re bound to like a hundred more, and this one delivers familiar thrills.

Lou Reed and Metallica
The View
"I am the root/I am the progress/I am the aggressor," James Hetfield bellows like vengeance itself in the thundering spaces betweenLou Reed&#039;sdry, unpitying harangue, in this song of destructive passion from Lulu, the strange-bedfellows record of the year. The full album runs the gamut of Reed andMetallica&#039;srespective extremes: his literary violence and love of drone, their wild-boy thrash and crushing power chords. But "The View" &ndash; with its crippled-march rhythm, sudden jump to double time and smeared-blues guitar outbursts by Kirk Hammett &ndash; is an effective introduction to the logic of this collaboration. Metallica are as raw and punishing, in theirMot&ouml;rhead-loving way, as the originalVelvet Underground, while the sadistic need in Reed&#039;s lyrics and you-dare-to-fuck-with-me? voice, in this setting, are real doom metal. "Pain and evil have their place sitting here beside me," he sings, armed with the badass band to make you believe him.

PJ Harvey
The Words That Maketh Murder
Fairly peppy for a PJ Harvey song about murder, this folky shuffle finds Polly Jean warbling about dead soldiers while hand claps and horns add to the oddly catchy melee.

The National
Think You Can Wait
The National have always had a grand cinematic element to their sound, so it&#039;s natural to hear them go widescreen for this theme from the filmWin Win. With piano, strings and elevating backing vocals, Matt Berninger croons about spiritual struggles: "I&#039;ll pull the devil down with me/One way or another."

The Joy Formidable
This Ladder Is Ours
The Welsh indie-rock trio leaven their ravenous sonic assault with an air of wistfulness, a combination that makes the towering drumbeats and rip-roaring riffs hit even harder; Ritzy Bryan&#039;s plain-spoken vocals slice through sonic chaos, balancing the melancholy of lost love with a hope that sounds almost serene.

Superchunk
This Summer
There are all kinds of summer jams; this one has heroically mangled guitars and lyrics about a cheapo&nbsp;beach vacation, complete with&nbsp;mixtapes, sweaty seats and sleeping bags. The B side to this seven-inch is a punked-up cover of Bananarama&#039;s 1983 hit "Cruel Summer," now with 20 percent more cruelty.

Wanda Jackson
Thunder on the Mountain

Maximum Balloon feat. Aku
Tiger
On the debut single from his new project, TV on the Radio&#039;s David Sitek comes up with the killer dance anthem TVOTR never quite delivered. Guest vocalist Aku growls over steely electro, and the "meow-meow" refrain offers a feline response to George Clinton&#039;s funk classic "Atomic Dog."

The Black Keys
Tighten Up
The Black Keys re-teamed with Danger Mouse to cut the first single off their new record — and they&#039;ve never sounded tighter or funkier. Drummer Patrick Carney pounds the skins like a drugged-up Keith Moon, and Dan Auerbach cranks out a spiky riff that&#039;s laced with Hendrix-style guitar effects. &#039;Tighten Up&#039; is definitely psychedelic, but these guys still have a thing for the blues: Auerbach yelps, &#039;Sick for days . . . I&#039;m aching now,&#039; with the raw intensity of Robert Johnson at the crossroads.

Britney Spears
Till the World Ends
Click to listen to Britney Spears&#039; "Till the World Ends"

Britney Spears feat. Nicki Minaj and Ke$ha
“Till the World Ends (The Femme Fatale Remix)”
Britney&#039;s kinkiest and trippiest single since "Toxic," if not ever, becomes a trash-disco Yalta. Co-writer Ke$ha drawls over the slowed-down sleaze-bot groove. But Minaj makes it a keeper; she sneers, "I ain&#039;t talking poultry when I say this chicken&#039;sfriiiiied," as synthesized fowl cluck along, summing up this remix&#039;s wild humor.

Rick Ross feat. Usher
Touch &#039;N You
"What&#039;s the problem with these rappers? They don&#039;t know how to play it cool," Usher says on the intro to Rick Ross&#039; latest single. For Ross, playing it cool means having producer Rico Love slow the tempo, bringing in Usher for a sexy chorus, and laying on muy suave rhymes ("Rose petals on her bed, I walk in unannounced"). As always, high romance is inseparable from high finance: "She kissin&#039; on me, biting on my bottom lip/In the Galleria all I get is &#039;Buy me this.&#039;... 50 stacks in her bag so she know it&#039;s real."&nbsp;

Missy Elliott feat. Timbaland
Triple Threat
The duo responsible for this century&#039;s most wacked-out and visionary party music is back with two songs from Elliott&#039;s upcoming first album in seven years &ndash; but the mood is not quite celebratory. Timbaland&#039;s beats (his finest in some time) have a dark cast, with classical flourishes brooding over minor keys and the usual woozy, oddly accented beats and blips. The lyrics find Missy in a defensive crouch: "Thought I fell off?/Ain&#039;t quite finished," she raps in "9th Inning." In the moderately more upbeat "Triple Threat," we get a hint of the old goofy braggart: "I&#039;m a pretty diva/Call me se&ntilde;orita..../Hits like Venus and Serena."

Mariah Carey (feat. Rick Ross and Meek Mill)
Triumphant (Get &#039;Em)
After an eventful hiatus &ndash; one marriage, two babies, an $18 million American Idol contract &ndash;Careyhas returned to her true calling: shattering stemware with falsetto trills. For most of this song she&#039;s bewilderingly AWOL, ceding the spotlight to Meek Mill and Rick Ross, who ably do their thing (i.e., brag about money). When Carey does turn it up, she&#039;s on-point, a self-help guru with a five-octave range.

Pusha-T feat. Tyler, the Creator
Trouble On My Mind
They don&#039;t sound troubled, actually. This is a model of unruffled swagger, with the Clipse&#039;s Pusha-T unfurling crack-rap metaphors and gloating over bin Laden&#039;s death, while Odd Future&#039;s Tyler, the Creator brags about sexploits - and, for some reason, his "ironed pair of Dockers."

Dan Deacon
True Thrush
The Baltimore cult fave pushes his crazy beat mutations further toward celebratory laptop pop. "Show me the sky, tell me I&rsquo;m home," he murmurs, as a dense fog of hand claps, synths and guitars helps make this a blurry beaut.

Chris Brown feat. Rihanna 
Turn Up The Music (Remix)
The musical reconciliation of Rihanna and Chris Brown raises a welter of emotions: outrage, sadness, bewilderment, revulsion. It&rsquo;s not merely, as some armchair psychoanalysts have suggested, evidence of crippling codependency; nor is it solely a morally obtuse publicity stunt. It&#039;s business as usual, consistent with the music that has made Rihanna a prolific hitmaker: From "Breakin&#039; Dishes" to "S&amp;M" her songs explore the violence of sex and, yes, the sexiness of violence. "Turn Up the Music" is proforma club R&amp;B that spices up Brown&rsquo;s simpering lead vocals with some flirty cooing from Rihanna. Her "Birthday Cake" is a more sonically arresting piece, a raucous mix of buzzes, beats and X-rated chants. Brown announces,"I wanna fuck you right now"; Rihanna ups the ante by turning sex into a power play: "I&#039;m-a make you my bitch." Is it coincidence that Rihanna is the dominatrix, and Brown the submissive who gets crushed beneath her leatherboot heel? The revenge is symbolic, of course. Unfortunately, symbolic victories are the only kind available to Rihanna &ndash; and evidently, they&#039;re the kind she cares about most.

Neil Young
Twisted Road
Neil Younghasn&#039;t dipped much into the old-time kiddie songs from this year&#039;sAmericanain his latest Crazy Horse shows. Instead, he&#039;s using this tour to blow minds with intense new tunes that come on like pieces of an in-progress autobiographical song cycle. "Twisted Road" is an acoustic beauty; Young reminisces about hearingDylanand theDeadon the radio. But "Walk Like a Giant" (also presumably from Young&#039;s next album, due this fall) is the mind-blower: an epic feedback monster, stretching to the 20-minute mark. It tackles familiar Young themes &ndash; the passing of time, the death of the hippie dream &ndash; with furious guitar noise and a whistle-along chorus. "Walk Like a Giant" is a fearsome sound: The old man takes a look at his life, and gets righteously pissed off at what he sees.

Danger Mouse and Daniele Luppi (feat. Jack White) 
Two Against One
Jack White&#039;s most ear-grabbing outburst since the end ofthe White Stripesain&#039;t punk blues. But it&#039;s some kinda blues, one of two leaks &mdash; Norah Jones&#039; Nancy Sinatra-ish "Black" is the other &mdash; from Danger Mouse&#039;s latest fantasy, a spaghetti-Western song cycle with composer Daniele Luppi. "The mirror is a trigger, and your mouth&#039;s a gun," White sings over haunted Ennio Morricone-style backing vocals, spinning couplets about a mercenary character in a heroic battle with his own self-loathing. The Stripes will be missed. But this bodes well for both White and Danger Mouse, who is clearly gunning for the "Most Supergroups" entry inGuinness World Records.

Jay-Z feat. Swizz Beatz
Ultra
&#039;Fuck the DA, the mayor know me,&#039; Jay raps on this new mixtape track. &#039;Ultra&#039; works the space between Roc Boy and society man, name-dropping Cosa Nostra and Obama over Swizz Beatz&#039;s police whistle and grinding static.

Weezer
Unbreak My Heart
From Weezer&#039;s new rarities collection, a cover of Toni Braxton&#039;s forlorn 1996 hit. In another band&#039;s hands, this might be a joke, but Rivers Cuomo moans the chorus like the words came straight from his diary.   

The Strokes
Under Cover of Darkness
Click to Listen to The Strokes&#039; "Under Cover of Darkness"

Blur
Under the Westway
Debuted live and acoustic in London, this drizzly Ray Davies-style ballad should sate anyone missing the Blur of old. "It was a quiet day in my city today/Everything was sinking," Damon Albarn sings mournfully, tying everyday London life to new heartbreak.

Mumford &amp; Sons
Untitled
This still-nameless ballad (fans are calling it "Home") sounds like Arcade Fire reborn as a string  band. Cut live in a radio station, it&#039;s a slow-builder that threatens to  explode but never does. It may be a taste of Mums&#039; upcoming LP; either  way, its sad hunger feels universal.

Blink-182
Up All Night
It&#039;s not exactly the "prog-rock Blink" that guitarist Tom DeLonge teased, but on their first track in six years, thereunited neo-punksdo get loopier than ever. The three-and-a-half minute anthem synthesizes the ideas already brewing on theGreatest Hitscut "Not Now": Jagged riffs smash into warbled sci-fi synths, as DeLonge and bassist Mark Hoppus trade glum proverbs &mdash; "Everyone lives to tell the tale of how we die alone someday," Hoppus wails &mdash; before wrapping it all up in one neat wallop.

Titus Andronicus
Upon Viewing Oregon&#039;s Landscape With the Flood of Detritus
New Jersey&#039;s finest punk-anthem makers dropped this new single, hip-hop style, in a free mixtape posted to their Tumblr (it will also surface on a split seven-inch single with their charmingly-named buds, Diarrhea Planet). It&#039;s a boozy free-for-all with backing hollers by kindred spirit Alex Levine of the So So Glos &ndash; the kind of nearly-falling-sideways stomper that the band&rsquo;s recent tour mates The Pogues do so well. When, in lieu of a chorus, everyone shouts "built to last" fourteeen times in the song&#039;s middle, you best believe them.&nbsp;

Coldplay
Us Against The World
These new songs &ndash; all debuted live in recent months but not yet released in studio versions &ndash; suggestColdplay&#039;sforthcoming album may be more gritty, fun, strange and (yes) danceable than any so far: aZooropato theUnforgettable Fireof 2008&#039;sViva la Vida. "Hurts Like Heaven" opened their Lollapalooza set with a word rush that occasionally recalledLCD Soundsystem&#039;s"All My Friends," plus some outstanding guitar asides. Broadcast on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, "Charlie Brown" (not the Coasters&#039; 1959 hit, alas) triangulatesSpringsteen,U2andArcade Firein a hood-rat oratorio that roars even if Chris Martin&#039;s delivery feels too genteel. "Us Against the World" (debuted at the Rock am Ring festival in Germany) is an anthemic ballad with sweet harmony vocals from drummer/secret weapon Will Champion. Most interesting may be "Princess of China," with a dubby drum track so huge, it apparently blew out all the bootleggers&#039; mics in Nuremberg.

Drive-By Truckers
Used to Be a Cop
Over seven minutes of tensely coiled Southern rock, Patterson Hood plays an ex-cop whose "temper and the shakes" cost him his badge, his family and his mind. Maybe he&#039;ll shoot up a Cracker Barrel. Either way, his too-human desolation is why Hood thinks he deserves a song this powerful.

Gucci Mane feat. Trina
Vampire
The persistent current popularity of blood-sucking bucks (and the chicks who love them) heads to the &#039;hood. Bypassing Team Edward and Team Jacob completely, teeth-barred Trina is "not remorsey" as she hops on Team Gucci: "Throw me in a movie/when you see me you salute true blood/ ooh-wee!" In turn, Gucci raps over tolling bells and casket-rattling bass in an appropriately undead rasp: "I believe in vampires/ lil&#039; shorty stay up all night/ trying to build an empire." On that note, expect a sequel shortly, shorty.

Lana Del Rey
Video Games
With her self-described "gangster Nancy Sinatra" look and crackedactress name, Lana Del Rey has a burnt mystique that&#039;s almost as striking as her debut single&#039;s torpid majesty. Del Rey (real name Lizzy Grant) stretches her sloshed-succubus pout over an orchestral track somewhere betweenCat PowerandFiona Apple, as she evokes a jobless afternoon of cheap, lazy splendor: "Kissing in the blue dark/Playing pool and wild darts/Video games?" The beautifully washed-out video only adds to the air of aimless decadence.

Girls
Vomit
Don&rsquo;t let the title turn you off: The first taste of the San Francisco band&rsquo;s second LP (out September 13th) is a lovesick mini-epic that has nothing to do with retching. Frontman Christopher Owens moans softly to someone who&rsquo;s forsaken him, sounding as lonesome as anyone since Neil Young madeOn the Beach. But then waves of fuzzed-out guitar and soothing harmonies lift him up to a state of gospel-tinged ecstasy.

John Legend
Wake Up
Legend and the Roots recorded Arcade Fire&#039;s anthem for their LPWake Up!, but it didn&#039;t make the cut. This live version suggests why: Legend&#039;s vocals miss Win Butler&#039;s cracked frailty, and the groove refuses to swing. But it&#039;s cool to hear the song becoming a 21st-century standard.

John Legend
Wake Up Everybody
"Wake Up Everybody" turns back the clock in all the right ways: The lead single from Legend&#039;s album with the Roots is a sparkling cover of Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes&#039; 1975 hit. Over string-drenched retro-funk, Legend splashes his ultrawarm croon all over, cool-rocking the pulpit like he owns the church. Guest rapper Common, meanwhile, stays right on message: "Even in this generation livin&#039; through computers/Only love, love, love can reboot us."

Neil Young
Walk Like a Giant
Neil Younghasn&#039;t dipped much into the old-time kiddie songs from this year&#039;sAmericanain his latest Crazy Horse shows. Instead, he&#039;s using this tour to blow minds with intense new tunes that come on like pieces of an in-progress autobiographical song cycle. "Twisted Road" is an acoustic beauty; Young reminisces about hearingDylanand theDeadon the radio.

R.E.M.
We All Go Back to Where We Belong
Click to listen to R.E.M.&#039;s &#039;We All Go Back To Where We Belong&#039;

Taylor Swift
We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together
Taylor Swift teamed with Swedish hit whisperers Max Martin and Shellback on her new single, and its hooks, plural, have a zing that&#039;s more Stockholm than Nashville. But it&#039;s unmistakably Taylor: a witty relationship postmortem, delivered in inimitable girlie-girl patois. And this bit &ndash; "...I&#039;m just, I mean, this is exhausting. Like, we are never getting back together. Like, ever" &ndash; might be the most sublime spoken-word interlude in pop sinceBarry Whitedied.

Rihanna feat. Calvin Harris
We Found Love
The first release fromRihanna&#039;s as-yet-untitled sixth LP is much ado about&nbsp;very little indeed. Scottish Euro-dance specialist Calvin Harris tosses&nbsp;pumped-up synths and 4/4 beats at an insipid tune and half-baked romantic&nbsp;catch-phrase - "We found love in a hopeless place" - which RiRi repeats&nbsp;approximately 350 times, hoping it will start to mean something. It&#039;s the&nbsp;worst single of Rihanna&rsquo;s career. It will probably top the Hot 100 anyway.

Bat For Lashes
We Found Love
In the wake ofColdplay&#039;spiano-rock version, Natasha Khan turnsRihanna&#039;sR&amp;B rave anthem into a slow-motion ballad, stripping it to little more than a funereal drumbeat and bass. Bleak, and beautiful.

Ke$ha
We R Who We R 
This Dr. Luke-produced anthem &mdash; about &quot;sick and sexified&quot; kids who wave their freak flags while hitting the clubs &mdash; was inspired by a rash of suicides among gay youth. Lady K and human rights are an awkward fit. But she gets credit for doing empowerment her way, even if the song (from an upcoming EP) suggests &quot;I Will Survive&quot; by way ofGirls Gone Wild.

Bruce Springsteen
We Take Care of Our Own
Anguish and challenge run thick and fast, at a martial-rock clip, in the first single from Bruce Springsteen&#039;s forthcoming election-year address,Wrecking Ball(due March 6th). "I&#039;ve been stumblin&#039; on good hearts turned to stone/The road of good intentions has turned dry as a bone," he laments in the first verse, a precise, devastating assessment of a nation exhausted by economic straits and locked in an uncivil war of values stoked by selfish Washington gridlock. It gets worse: "Where are the hearts that run over with mercy?" Springsteen asks with deep ragged disbelief. "Where&#039;s the work that will set my hands, my soul free?" There is a quick reference to a shame that now seems like a lifetime ago: the black and poor of New Orleans, abandoned to sweaty feral hell in the Superdome during Hurricane Katrina. But it is a still-dark stain on our honor, now acted out in campaign vitriol about lengthening welfare rolls and the "food stamp president."

Snoop Dogg
Wet
Created for Prince William&#039;s bachelor party ("and all bachelor parties around the world to follow"), Snoop&#039;s new single is a bit of seductive minimalism that packs an R. Kelly album&#039;s worth of sex metaphors into four laid-back minutes: "Be my head coach," "I can give it to you rough, like a first draft," "I&#039;m in between your lips, like a cigarette." Amusing stuff &mdash; but what would the Queen think?&nbsp;

One Direction
What Makes You Beautiful 
The boy-band cycle rears its head with this inevitable tween lady-killer, a self-esteem jolt ("You&rsquo;re insecure, don&#039;t know what for") sung over pop- rock crunch by five pristinely coiffed lads. They make the JoBros look like Betty White&#039;s used toys.

Avril Lavigne
What the Hell
Avril Lavigne is pop&#039;s presiding mean girl, sneering and snarling like a punk kewpie doll with Tourette&#039;s over some of the most sticky-sweet melodies ever to hit theBillboardcharts. "What the Hell" is Avril in a nutshell: Co-written by Max Martin, it&#039;s an anthem about a good girl who goes on a crazy-bender, staying out late, swapping boys and exacting psychological revenge. She starts out defiant ("All I want is to mess around") and quickly turns vicious: "I am messing with your head/When I&#039;m messing with you in bed." (In fairness, the dude has been pretty neglectful.) The music is easily some of Avril&#039;s catchiest yet, with piping garage-rock organs, a pogoing, do-the-frug beat and a soaring singalong chorus. It&#039;s strychnine disguised as bubblegum.

Florence and the Machine
What the Water Gave Me
There are megawatts of raw power contained withinFlorence Welch&#039;s larynx, and she wrings out every last one on the first tune from her forthcoming second album. She takes her sweet time getting there, though. The track opens softly, with Welch cooing slightly spooky pastoral poetry ("Time, it took us to where the water was"). But soon enough, she&#039;s out-and-out howling about learning to let go after a failed relationship, ancient Greek giants and possibly drowning herself. Her veiled incantations feel like the stuff of myth, even if it&#039;s not entirely clear how the images relate to one another. Producer Paul Epworth expertly amps the drama, surrounding Welch with roiling organ chords, deep bass rumblings and looming choral harmonies as the song builds. It&#039;s a late-summer storm with that voice shining through the thunderheads

Evanescence
What You Want
On the lead single fromEvanescence&#039;sthird album (and first in five years), Amy Lee trades anguish for defiance, goosing her wail with welcome sass. Still, she&#039;s nearly overrun by the music, a collision of two-ton guitars, strings and piano.

Pink
Whataya Want From Me
Pink&#039;s original recording of the hit she co-wrote for Adam Lambert reveals that Lambert&#039;s producers more or less replaced her voice with his. Lambert&#039;s desperation gives him the edge, but this would have fit well on any Pink album.

Rihanna feat. Drake
What&#039;s My Name
With the second single from the forthcomingLoud,Rihanna has created a perfect little tropical storm: Over dark, humid synths and swirling snare skitters, she&#039;s in full-on Caribbean-queen mode, dialing up her islander accent and rolling out a to-do list for any adult male seeking entrance into her chambers: &quot;Hey, boy, I really wanna see if you can go downtown with a girl like me,&quot; she sings, kicking off the chorus. Her former fling Drake further steams things up with a little, um, math: &quot;The square root of 69 is 8-something,&quot; he offers, sounding like the nerdy guy in a fraternity. The end result isn&#039;t quite &quot;Umbrella,&quot; but between its star power, sex appeal and the impeccably sculpted chorus, &quot;What&#039;s My Name&quot; seems like it&#039;s destined for ubiquity. Even Chris Brown has tweeted in support of the song&#039;s dopeness. For all his faults, Brown at least knows who&#039;s on top these days.

Nada Surf
When I Was Young
A Fleet Fox-y tune that ramps into a slow-mo rocker, the trio&#039;s new track flashes back to salad days but savors a grown-up present, where "aimless dreaming has found a target" and true love &ndash; with afternoon quickies! &ndash; beckons. Youth: still somewhat overrated.

Robbie Robertson
When the Night Was Young 
FromHow to Become Clairvoyant, Robertson&#039;sfirst album since 1998, this pretty, wistful reminiscence finds the former Band man longing for the days when he hung out with "card sharks and grifters" and thought he could change the world.

Best Coast
When You Wake Up
On this seven-inch single, Bethany Cosentino keeps up her hook-packed surf-pop revival with an artfully artless sketch of doomed puppy love: "Tell me you love me/Even if you don&#039;t/I need to hear it."

Ashlyne Huff
White Flag
Click to Listen to Ashlyne Huff&#039;s "White Flag"

David Byrne and St. Vincent
Who
This is a generational genius summit of the first order. Byrne and 29 year-old art-pop wunderkind Annie Clark both share a love of wiry tunefulness and worldly grooves. But the casual chemistry they display on the first song they&#039;ve released fromLove This Giant, their collaborative album due this fall, is still kind of shocking; "Who" has a &nbsp;bit of earlyTalking Heads&#039; airy minimalism, sharpened by smartly collaged horns, chain-gang vocal samples and noise-knot guitar shots. &nbsp;And Clark is a hell of a high-IQ hook girl.

J. Cole
Who Dat
North Carolina rapper/producer J. Cole is Jay-Z&#039;s first signing to his new Roc Nation imprint. Though Jigga sees Cole as rap&#039;s future, his debut single is lodged in the recent past. "Who Dat" echoes the timeless flamethrowing of early-2000s Roc-A-Fella tracks like Freeway&#039;s "What We Do" or Memphis Bleek&#039;s "My Mind Right": repetitive head-knocking beat, chopped-up soul-sample stammer, and no one bothering to croon a chorus. Hov himself says it reminded him of Biggie&#039;s "Hypnotize." Its minimalism makes for a bold, unlikely debut in the age of the Rihanna/Hayley/Drake monster hook, but Cole&#039;s beats and boasts approach is a breath of fresh air.

Katy Perry
“Wide Awake”
And you thought her divorce merited just one angst-pop anthem. Katy Perry whiffed with her first Russell Brand-breakup ballad, the guitar-powered"Part of Me."(Revenge like that is a dish best served byKelly Clarkson.) "Wide Awake," another cut from the deluxe edition ofTeenage Dream, is more her speed: a mid-tempo ballad, with throbbing dance-pop production. Perry&#039;s A-team &ndash; Max Martin, Dr. Luke and Bonnie McKee &ndash; delivers the goods, packing "Wide Awake" with hooks and sealing the deal with a monster chorus. Choice lyric for the tabloid jackals: "Outta the lion&#039;s den/I don&#039;t have to pretend/The story&#039;s over now/The end."

TV on the Radio
Will Do
The first single from TV on the Radio&#039;s fifth album is a relatively straightforward declaration of heartache from some cerebral artistes &ndash; and one of the band&#039;s prettiest songs ever. "Will Do" wraps Tunde Adebimpe&#039;s falsetto in fuzzy synths, atonal guitars and chamber-group strings, as he pledges his heart to someone who won&#039;t be returning the favor any time soon. "I&#039;ll be there to take care of you if ever you should decide that you don&#039;t want to waste your life in the middle of a lovesick lullaby," Adebimpe sighs, a gangster of love set against excellent atmospheric throb.

Bon Iver
With God on Our Side
"The country I come from is called the Midwest," sings devout Wisconsinite Justin Vernon on his stately cover ofDylan&#039;sgreat anti-war lesson, performed live at a Portland gig. Vernon leaves Auto-Tune aside, setting the mood with Bill Frisell-style electric guitar and a mournful military trumpet. As timely as ever, regrettably.

Rostam
Wood
The Vampire Weekend talent pool runs deep. This elegant track from Rostam Batmanglij is a different flavor from his electro-pop project, Discovery, with its sitar, hand drums and strings; imagine David Byrne sleepwalking through a Bollywood musical.

Wiz Khalifa feat. Lil Wayne and Young Jeezy
Work Hard Play Hard (Remix)
Despite its title, no one on this relentlessly half-assed ode to long money sounds as if he&#039;s expending much effort or having much fun. Weezy is pretty open about what he&#039;d rather be doing: "My dick stay hard/But suck my skateboard." He&#039;s got the "bored" part right.

Divine Fits
Would That Not Be Nice
This latest leak from the debut album by indie supergroup Divine Fits (Spoon&#039;s Brett Daniel, Wolf Parade/Handsome Furs&#039; Dan Boeckner, and New Bomb Turks drummer Sam Brown) is something close to an ideal garage rock record: a delectable admixture of rubbery groove, scuzz, melody, psychedelic effects, and mumbo-jumbo. Daniel takes the lead, growling trippy responses to the titular question &ndash; barely intelligible, possibly nonsensical, totally irresistible stuff about Minneapolis, "a candelabra," rice, and "Cleopatra upon her throne."

Le1f
Wut
Doing for booty-fiend club jams whatFrank Ocean does for r&amp;b bromance, Harlem producer/rapper Le1f (see Das Racist&#039;s "Combination Pizza Hut And Taco Bell") comes on like a drag-ballMissy Ellioton this single from his freeDark Yorkmixtape. Name-checking Missy&#039;s "Hit &#039;Em Wit Da Hee" over slo-mo horn splats and bass drops, he shifts between horny snap-queen ("I need my oreos double-stuffed") and double-speed battle-rhymer, claiming the slur "light in his loafers" as a gay pride declaration likes it&rsquo;s no big deal at all, which makes it even more of one.

M.I.A.
XXXO
With its ultraviolent video and synth-punk harshness, the Sri Lankan antidiva&#039;s most recent offering, "Born Free," suggested that her forthcoming third disc might be aimed at only her fringiest fans. So it&#039;s a big relief that the album&#039;s first official single is a frisky slice of dance heaven, with M.I.A. setting aside radical chic for a fiendishly sexy disco jam. Over sinewy and atmospheric future-techno throb from Baltimore producer Blaqstarr, M.I.A. drops uncharacteristically flirty lines like "I can be the actress/You be Tarantino" and "A knock at the door and then we hit the floor." But when M.I.A. gets to the chorus, she adopts a thin, high-pitched wail, tingeing the foxy track with ambivalence and a hint of discord. "You want me be somebody who I&#039;m really not," she says. Is she speaking to some segment of her audience? Hard to say, but it&#039;s clear that even when M.I.A. heads into Fergie country, she does it on her own idiosyncratic terms.

Fucked Up
Year of the Tiger
The Ontario punks&#039; fifth Chinese New Year single is a 15-minute hardcore odyssey narrated by the scabrous howls of Damian Abraham. "The tiger lives afraid as the tiger dies," he roars &ndash; but by the end, it&#039;s frightened of exactly no one.

Tyler, the Creator
Yonkers
Who says the kids are all right? Over a dark, chorus-free drone, the 19-year-old Angeleno (who heads up blog-beloved rap crew Odd Future) shouts out his therapist and dreams of stabbing "Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus." It&#039;s gleeful psychodrama that makes Kanye seem well-adjusted.

Romeo Santos
You
Romeo Santos &mdash; who, in Aventura, fronted the world&#039;s most popular Latin band &mdash; is a ladykiller with an unearthly falsetto that recalls Aaron Neville&#039;s. His  debut solo single blends Dominican bachata with R&amp;B &mdash; plus coos and  come-ons in Spanish and English &mdash; with predictably suave results.

Death Cab For Cutie
You Are a Tourist
Death Cab frontman Ben Gibbard made his name as an indie-rock anti-charismatic &ndash; a gawky master of melancholy. But on the first single from the band&#039;s eighth album, he tries out a new role: self-help guru. "When there&#039;s a burning in your heart. . . . /Build it bigger than the sun/Let it grow," he sings. The advice floats over a buoyant yet muscular groove, and ringing guitars push toward the arena-friendly rock of Coldplay and U2. The "inspirational" message feels flat &ndash; but the bright package it&#039;s wrapped in inspires trust

Mavis Staples
You Are Not Alone
Jeff Tweedy produces an album by a gospel-soul legend at Wilco&#039;s Chicago headquarters and writes her a couple of songs to boot. An odd pairing? Perhaps. But this first taste, a simple soul-folk tune &agrave; la Bill Withers&#039; "Lean on Me," driven by acoustic guitar, celesta and piano, is the sweetest Tweedy song in a while. And Staples — a civil-rights-era front-liner who dated Dylan — sounds, at 71, as inspiring as ever. "Isolated and afraid/Open up, this is a raid," she sings. "I wanna get it through to you/You&#039;re not alone." Amen, sister.

Bryan Ferry
You Can Dance
As the former frontman of Roxy Music, this arch romantic sets a mighty high bar. He doesn&#039;t reach it on this slow-grinding single, but the layered guitars and Ferry&#039;s suave croon make for an elegant celebration of sexual tension.

The Rolling Stones
You Can&#039;t Always Get What You Want
"Honky Tonk Women" would have made a great twenty minute cut onthe Stones&#039; new album; as it is this disc is most likely the strongest three minutes of rock and roll yet released in 1969. It deserves twenty minutes because the Stones give us just the most tantalizing taste of everything they do well, of everything they do the best. In spite ofMick&#039;s screaming, joyful singing, this time the star of the show isKeith Richards. He combines the cleanest, toughest guitar lines in rock with Charlie Watts&#039; jingling cowbell and steady drum shots for an introduction very similar to and equally as dramatic as that of Marvin Gaye&#039;s "I Heard It Through the Grapevine." Keith moves off after that, really fronting Mick himself, stretching sex with a smile out of every note, running up to the choruses with the same kind of perfect excitement Mike Bloomfield displayed on "Like a Rolling Stone." On the last two choruses Richard sings beautifully behind Mick, bending the words in counterpoint to Mick&#039;s straight shouts: "It&#039;s a haaaaawwww-aw-aw-aw-aw-kytonky woman! Bam! Gimme, Gimme, Gimme, Gimme . . . " It would have been a special gas to hear Keith sing a chorus all by himself.

Cobra Starship
You Make Me Feel...
Except for a riff that suggests Pink&#039;s "Raise Your Glass," guitars take a  timeout from the pop pranksters&#039; new one. Gabe Saporta drops weak  pickup lines, but guest diva Sabi calls herself "the baddest baby in the  atmosphere," and is right.

Rick Ross feat. Nicki Minaj
You the Boss
Bitches aren&#039;t the only things that Rick Ross loves. For one thing, there&#039;s alliteration: "Bottles, Beamers, brandnew Benzes/Barbies, ballerinas andBritneys/Barbra Streisand-edition Bentleys." (One might add booming beats and boasts as big as that beard.) The first of two singles from the Miami MC&#039;s fifth solo album &ndash;God Forgives, I Don&#039;t, due out December 13th &ndash; is topnotch Ross, with the rapper delivering a torrent of witty brags (about everything from his sexploits to his taste for lobster bisque) over a chipmunk soul beat from Just Blaze. By comparison, Ross&#039; second new track, "You the Boss," is a dud: a pro forma foray into bedroom rap, with some extremely annoying Auto-Tuned warbling from Ms. Minaj. Ross being Ross, romance gets conflated with finance &ndash; his real true love: "All I fiend is a queen in my presence/I can hold her until I die/ Couple G&#039;s in my bezel."

Japandroids
Younger Us
Listening to a couple of young dudes wax nostalgic way too soon about their even-younger selves is usually obnoxious but this ferocious, garage rock duo out of Vancouver has so much fun reminiscing between fist-pumping drums and dirty guitar that they&#039;ll make you fondly remember all the way back to a couple of months ago too.

Christina Aguilera
Your Body
You can measure a singer&#039;s place in the pop-star pecking order by the quality of the Max Martin/Shellback song she releases. For Xtina, the news ain&#039;t good.
